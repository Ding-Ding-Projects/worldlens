# Changelog

Every entry here is one commit from this repository's history, carrying the full SHA of
that commit so the claim can be checked. Versions are the tags the release workflow
published; a version's entries are the commits reachable from its tag and from no earlier
tag. The date shown is the tagged commit's own date, because the tags are lightweight and
the GitHub Release for a tag is published minutes later by the same run.

Entries are grouped by the area of the repository they changed, which is derived from the
paths each commit touched. They are deliberately not classified as features or fixes: the
commits here carry no such marker, so any such label would be inferred from the wording of
a subject line, and a changelog that infers is a changelog that eventually says something
nobody wrote.

This file is generated. Run `node scripts/build-changelog.mjs` to rebuild it, and
`node scripts/build-changelog.mjs --check` to prove it is current. Generation fails rather
than emitting a reference to a commit that cannot be resolved. The same command writes
`design/packages/ui/src/components/changelog/changelogData.generated.ts`, which carries each commit's
full message for the in-app changelog viewer.
