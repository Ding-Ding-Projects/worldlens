# Roadmap

## Ground-up Material Design 3 Expressive Pages rewrite (2026-08-07)

**Integrated into `main` at `de324d7`; exact-tip CI and live deployment proof remain
gates.** The documentation site now has one explicit application-shell owner instead of assembling
its hierarchy through append order: sticky M3 top app bar, adaptive navigation surface, bounded
content canvas and persistent local-assets footer. Search, notification history, settings and the
command palette are real quick actions. The lens-and-voxel brand mark, shell surfaces, responsive
drawer/scrim, forced-colour branch and reduced-motion branch are derived from the existing Material
system tokens and controllers.

The Home surface also carries twelve distinct finite GIF walkthroughs covering navigation,
command palette, documentation search, regex construction, theme, language/tone, tab groups, tab
discovery, notifications, changelog filtering, appearance and verified downloads. Every animation
is bundled locally, silent, lazy-loaded, captioned in both languages, reserved at 640×400 and paired
with a static reduced-motion image. The 427,520-byte total is guarded alongside GIF/PNG decode,
dimensions, uniqueness, file budgets, finite playback, narrow layout and offline build resolution.

Focused shell/content/coverage/walkthrough tests, site typecheck and a production build are green
except for the final full-suite and runtime matrix still to run after documentation is complete. A
local build and explanatory animation are not live-deployment proof; exact main CI, Pages workflow
and live URL read-back remain later gates.
## Startup resilience and Worldlens brand phase (2026-08-07)

**Merged through the completion pass; packaged and hosted proof remain open.** The app
now preserves an ordinary shell when optional startup features fail and uses an isolated recovery
window when profile, preload, renderer or unknown-process integrity makes the ordinary shell unsafe.
The recovery route is persistent, non-modal where the ordinary shell survives, inspectable,
copyable, exportable in JSON and Markdown, credential-redacted, and protected against repeated
submits. Every known startup phase appears in a hand-written completeness guard.

The phase also replaces the inherited BlueMap mark with one Worldlens source image and a
deterministic Sharp pipeline for the app/UI/site PNGs plus a nine-size Windows ICO. Windows resource
editing applies the icon and version metadata without enabling code signing. Focused tests (61),
app/UI/site typecheck and brand freshness are green locally. The remaining gates are the complete
build-first test/lint/build suite, unpacked and installer packaging, Authenticode `NotSigned`
confirmation, cheap off-screen launch with the profile-migration probe, a genuine issue capture,
exact main CI and a verified release.

## Worldlens repository pre-cutover expansion (2026-08-07)

The repository remains at `Ding-Ding-Projects/material-bluemap`; this checkpoint does **not**
rename it, change Pages, update the wiki or publish final Worldlens URLs. The phase branch is based
exactly on default-branch commit `64858ee71f2ee47e07dd7f6aa0de969e5ac3be02` and expands the
atomic finalizer from eight pre-Pages targets to 17 current-display targets. The added inventory
covers the desktop crash-report URL; the site noscript, clone, central repository/base and issue
sources; compact proof routing; and the generator, Markdown and in-app forms of current changelog
links. Historical evidence and the legacy updater/profile/schema/storage readers remain unchanged.

The transaction tests now synthesize their exact pre-cutover fixtures from the replacement plan,
so the same rollback and cleanup suite remains valid after the real cutover. Repository-state
tests accept only all-ready or all-finalized state and carry a negative deliberately mixed probe.
Build, all 13 package typechecks, ESLint, 197 focused tests with one history-dependent skip, the
complete 366-second `test:ci`, 43 workflow/catalog tests, workflow lint, changelog freshness and
the 17-file no-write preflight are green locally. Cloud branch verification is still an evidence
gate; repository rename, wiki updates, homepage change and `/worldlens/` Pages deployment remain
later cutover steps.

## Pages parity exact-main integration checkpoint (2026-08-07)

The phase branch now contains merge commit `f713d1a5dcbc2209711f24b3ca5b7a2b3c584916`, whose second
parent is exact corrected default-branch commit `ff2a8db67329311357f3ffe858d1d78b25ac7ab1`.
Worldlens identity, permanently unsigned release/update truth, final release timing and the direct
checksum asset coexist with all 41 Pages requirement categories, the compact side-navigation
contract, scheduled/session-only external-source rules, shared panel geometry and schema-v2 proof.
Physical links continue to use `material-bluemap` until the repository rename actually happens.

The exact `/material-bluemap/` production build passes the full 18-scenario off-screen compact
matrix across desktop, mobile, bilingual and 200% scale. Local build, lint, all 13 package
typechecks, the complete 352.2-second `test:ci`, changelog validation, 43 workflow/picker tests and
workflow lint are terminal green. This checkpoint remains branch-only: exact hosted branch CI,
default-branch integration and live Pages deployment proof are still required, so issue #92 stays
open and the public site is not described as updated yet.

## GitHub Pages mobile navigation and global-feature parity (2026-08-07)

**Implemented on `codex/phase-pages-global-parity`; default-branch deployment proof remains with
the integration flow.** Left/right site navigation now has a localized, focus-retaining collapse
control. A compact first visit starts collapsed with a minimum-size expand target still visible;
an explicit visitor choice persists across reloads and viewport changes, while reset returns to the
responsive default. Top and bottom placement remain complete horizontal strips.

The documentation site now carries a hand-written inventory of 41 shared requirements. The added
rows cover scheduled language/appearance rules with local, bounded JSON API and Home Assistant
boolean sources, plus one shared geometry controller for settings panels, tab panels, anchored
panels and interactive overlays. Rules are versioned and bounded, preserve base-value recovery and
history, validate timezone/cross-midnight/equal-endpoint behaviour, keep Home Assistant tokens only
in page-session memory, let `off` fall through to the next matching rule, and fail closed on
unavailable/authentication responses. Panels resize, every transient panel including menus drags,
stays viewport-bounded, persists per surface, resets visibly and exposes keyboard move/resize paths.

Eighteen exact schema-v2 headless records and fourteen genuine captures cover ten routes: Home, Settings,
Schedules/external sources, Search/regex, command-palette teleport, appearance, notification
history, changelog/date filtering, tab/group menus and exports/bulk actions. The driver no longer
truncates overflow candidates; it classifies every one as accidental or an intentional internal
scroller and fails accidental clipping, an undersized target, broken `aria-controls`, missing
toggle inversion or localized label change, a missing scenario, or an incorrect final navigation
state. A committed guard rejects legacy/incomplete records. The runtime pass also corrected the
expanded compact rail width, appearance-editor width and wrapping, startup-surprise dismiss target,
button/search/tab targets and scheduled checkbox rows. See `../docs/pages-feature-parity.md`,
`../docs/scheduled-settings-and-external-sources.md`, `../docs/panel-geometry.md` and issue #92.

Focused schedule, geometry and content-policy tests plus site typecheck/build are green locally.
The final repository lint, all 13 package typechecks, complete `pnpm test:ci` and exact hosted run
are re-run after this evidence commit; until they finish, they remain pending rather than inferred
from the earlier 344.7-second branch run. A local build is not evidence of the live Pages
deployment; that exact URL and default-branch workflow remain open until integration.

## Release expression and catalog-metadata hardening (2026-08-07)

**Implemented on `codex/phase-release-expression-hardening`; exact-main integration and release
read-back remain with the root release flow.** All 19 dynamic-expression sites present in assigned
baseline `e13777927876a3d7898778f18193e9465bc97cc2` now cross through exact environment mappings and
quoted data-only sinks. The workflow defaults to read permission, grants write only to `release`,
and all eight release-chain checkouts decline credential persistence. The release explicitly waits
for the workflow-security job before publication.

The hand-written guard pins three steps, thirteen variable/provenance pairs, their complete
normalized `env`/`run` fingerprints, the complete release-job structure, and all 49 external action
SHAs across `ci.yml` and `build-jars.yml`. Every executable release region is scanned irrespective
of display name, so a newly inserted adjacent step fails. Exact historical workflows stay red:
recovered `98988e3` at 11 sites and the
assigned baseline at 19. The picker validates all 2,866 current catalog records, accepts the genuine
235-character longest alt, caps declared and streamed photo bytes, and verifies PNG chunk ordering,
IHDR combinations, indexed-palette bounds and CRCs. Same-run digests also verify transported CLI,
installer and test-world bytes without claiming the producer itself is trusted. Focused tests pass
43/43 on Windows and Linux; Ubuntu 24.04 actionlint 1.7.12 with real shellcheck passes locally over
every workflow. The source is integrated at `e21aaee`; exact-main CI and release read-back remain
evidence-gated. See `../docs/release-workflow-security.md` and issue #90.

## Worldlens rename and migration (2026-08-07)

**Implemented on the phase branch; independent review corrections add crash recovery, guarded
filesystem containment, exact pre-cutover manifest revalidation and a version-independent
dual-feed installed-client bridge, while repository rename and release publication remain external
follow-up gates.** Code/package/preload/installer/data identifiers now use Worldlens. Legacy
profiles, localStorage preferences, environment variables, project files and ownership markers
have explicit compatibility adapters; current writes never create another legacy identifier.
Unknown project fields survive the v1-to-v2 schema adapter.

The final current-identity inventory began in `637cc69`: release and helper output,
standalone regex-builder branding and storage, capture automation, generated changelog targets and
current feature documentation use Worldlens, while each retained legacy reader is named in an
explicit allowlist. The 17-file repository, Pages, policy and legal switch is staged behind a
deterministic preflight/apply/verify finalizer until the real repository rename succeeds. Its
install-and-verify transaction now reaches an explicit committed state before cleanup begins;
cleanup failure preserves every finalized target and retains the backups it did not remove. A
disposable plan-generated integration matrix proves no-write readiness, normal completion, both
pre-commit rollback boundaries, and cleanup-only failure. The capture legacy allowance is pinned
to exact current-first alias sites and includes a negative write probe; the two former names in
`AGENTS.md` remain untouched as classified project-instruction metadata. The reviewed Options-tab
screenshot activation repair is incorporated as `522e3b5` without a default-branch merge. Local
focused tests pass 36/36; full `test:ci`, 13-package typecheck/build, lint and unsigned Windows
packaging pass. Exact branch run `31170094158` passed 9,623 tests, all 24 required screenshots,
the installer, Java builds, real CLI round trip and generated-world render at commit `5652d185`.

Packaging is permanently unsigned and verified as such at the built executable. The migration
has unit coverage for POSIX containment, linked-root escape rejection, Windows case-only
collisions and injected concurrent current-profile writes, plus an isolated copy of the actual
885-file legacy profile. Final completion still requires default-branch integration, repository rename, exact-SHA CI/release proof, and
fresh cheap-headless screenshots from the integrated packaged build. The phase branch's freshly
packaged migration-consent gate has already been captured off-screen as a pre-integration proof.

## Screenshot required-surface interaction repair (2026-08-07)

**Implemented on `codex/phase-screenshot-ci-repair`; exact cloud screenshot verification is
pending.** The Options editor capture loop now activates a tab through its visible label rather
than clicking the parent tab's geometric centre. This prevents the longer **Server plugin** tab's
nested 44 px close button from receiving what was intended as an activation click. The previous
interaction removed one of eight tabs and made the following `innerText()` lookup wait for an
entry the harness itself had deleted.

The hard `REQUIRED_SURFACES` assertion is unchanged, as are the element and surface timeouts.
Local workspace build, app typecheck, focused formatting/lint, and 2,625 app tests passed. The
branch proof is green in run `31170094158`; the phase still needs an exact-main run after
integration before the issue can close.

## Four-edge tabs and nested-editor interaction repair (2026-08-06)

**Implemented and integrated; packaged hidden-desktop capture remains a separate runtime gate.**
Desktop and documentation-site tab strips now occupy the physical left, right, top or bottom
edge. Placement is part of storage schema v2, with a version-1 migration that preserves the
existing tabs, pins, groups, order, collapsed state, membership and appearance while supplying
the old left-edge default. Overflow, drag ordering and keyboard navigation follow the selected
axis, including RTL-aware horizontal arrows.

The Project Editor's nested strip is interactive again. Only the outer map shell opts into panel
pointer pass-through; nested panels explicitly keep pointer input, Enter and Space activate their
tabs, Add a map focuses the inline form, and presets focus the first editable map. The live-speed
restart route now carries both `render-thread-count` and `render-thread-priority` across the real
UI/preload/main bridge and writes both for local and Docker replacement renders. Responsive work
keeps primary project, tab, search and live-speed targets at 44 CSS pixels, stacks constrained
layouts, wraps long labels and bounds overlays to the viewport.

The implementation is `09b05a1` through `d25a6c9`. Focused Project Editor, live-speed,
throughput and sizing verification passed 43/43 after integration, and the UI typecheck passed.
The real preload object is exercised by `packages/app/src/preload/liveSpeedBridge.test.ts`; config
tests cover both deferred fields and invalid priority. A real packaged screenshot or interaction
through the required hidden-desktop route is not implied by those DOM, bridge and CSS checks.

## Exact-SHA release-gate repair (2026-08-06)

**Complete on `codex/phase-release-gates`; default-branch integration and release publication
remain with the root workflow.** The four failures that stopped the manual release at
`215307ac05ecf86728831da9429aac48d2bc03dd` are repaired in `77c1222`: the CI-render account
warning and GitHub-account recovery action have complete catalogue coverage, the cloud-runner
article is explicitly categorized under Rendering, and the real CLI watcher e2e waits for
chokidar's initial-scan readiness before writing the region event it verifies. The real
five-second debounce and both scheduling assertions remain intact.

Focused tests passed 69/69. Repository lint, all 13 package typechecks, all 13 package builds,
and the full `pnpm test:ci` passed locally; the full suite exited 0 on its first attempt after
598.6 seconds. The upstream webapp bundle was present, so the CLI render/watch cases ran rather
than reporting an environment skip. No remote workflow or release result is claimed for this
local phase.

## GitHub-hosted runner restoration (2026-08-06)

**Implemented on the cloud-runner phase branch; hosted runtime proof follows default-branch
integration.** All 23 executable jobs across the seven repository workflows now select an
explicit standard GitHub-hosted label: Ubuntu for Linux build/test/render/release/Pages work and
Windows for Squirrel packaging. The 13 reusable-workflow call jobs retain their exact checked-in
targets. Pull-request validation is restored now that contributor code runs on disposable hosted
environments instead of a project-owned machine.

The obsolete composite bootstrap, OS scripts, focused fake-missing tests and bootstrap article are
gone. Manifest-driven pnpm, Node and Java setup plus the frozen lockfile remain unchanged. The
replacement hand-written guard inventories all 36 jobs and rejects unknown workflows, missing or
non-standard runner labels, illegal labels on reusable calls, and any self-hosted/bootstrap return.
See `../docs/cloud-runners.md`. Local policy, YAML, actionlint, typecheck and site-build evidence
must pass again after integration; no hosted run is claimed before the branch reaches the default
branch.

Phases from `../plan.md`; status is updated as each phase lands on the branch. Read
`docs/decisions.md` first: decisions **D17** and **D18** (2026-08-03) changed which engine
renders, and that change reorders some of what follows.

## Which engine renders, today and later

|                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local rendering today**            | Upstream BlueMap's **Java engine**, built from the vendored source at `vendor/BlueMap` and driven by the app as a child process                                                                                                                                                              |
| **The Phase D gate**                 | Decompressed PRBM bytes identical to the Java engine's, and lowres PNGs identical pixel for pixel, on every fixture world. **Closed 2026-08-04**                                                                                                                                             |
| **Local rendering standing default** | The **Java engine stays the default**, by D17's amendment of 2026-08-05 — the gate closing did not itself switch anything. The **TypeScript mesher** in `packages/engine` keeps being written and takes over only through a later, separately verified switch decision with its own evidence |
| **How you can tell which ran**       | Every render writes `render.json` beside its output naming the engine, its version and the JVM. The app shows it. Nothing switches silently                                                                                                                                                  |

This reverses the pure-TypeScript position in D5 for the interval, not for the end state.
The reasoning and the cost are in `docs/decisions.md` (D17, and its 2026-08-05 amendment)
and in `../plan.md` (Amendment 1). The short version: the mesher is the largest and
highest-risk part of the port, and until it was finished the app rendered nothing at all.
Driving upstream's engine meant a world could render from day one, and it gave the mesher
an exact oracle to be checked against instead of an approximation that looks plausible.
That oracle now reports byte-identical output (below), and the Java engine remains the
default anyway: passing the gate was never the same decision as flipping the default, and
D17's amendment says so in writing rather than leaving it to be assumed the moment the
oracle went green.

**What is proven, on the machine D17 was decided on.** `./gradlew :cli:shadowJar` produces
`implementations/cli/build/libs/cli-5.22-27-shadow.jar` (6.4 MB, 34s warm), and that jar
rendered a generated 1000x1000 world to **961 hires PRBM tiles** plus lowres PNGs and
`textures.json.gz` in 80 seconds. `GRADLE_USER_HOME` points at `tools/oracle/.gradle`, which
is gitignored, so no machine-wide toolchain is touched.

**What that costs.** A JDK is required for local rendering; the app provisions a verified
Temurin build into its own `userData` when the machine has none, so nobody installs one by
hand, but the download is real and is the user's decision. There are two rendering paths to
maintain until the mesher lands, and the project's JVM-free claim is conditional until then.

**D18** follows from D17: since there is a JVM in the product, the six Minecraft-server
platform adapters (`fabric`, `forge`, `neoforge`, `paper`, `spigot`, `sponge`) and the Java
addon loader are no longer inert, so they are built and shipped rather than excluded. Plan
exclusions **S2 and S4 are withdrawn**; S1 and S3 still stand.

Phase **J** is not in `plan.md`: the plan had no Java render path because it had no JVM.
It is numbered out of the alphabet deliberately so the original lettering keeps meaning what
it meant.

## Phase E, what is ported and what is not

Ported on 2026-08-04, in `packages/engine/src/map/rendermanager/`:

- **The RenderManager worker pool** (`3119425`, `RenderManager.ts`, `ProgressTracker.ts`).
  The queue, the workers, the ordering, the progress reporting and the retirement rules.
  The structure that has to survive review: every worker calls `doWork()` on the _same_
  head-of-queue task until it reports no more work, so the parallelism lives inside a task
  rather than across tasks. Java's locks became something else in five named places, each
  documented where it happened. One construct has no upstream counterpart — a yield on
  elapsed time — because an async loop that never awaits anything real starves the `stop()`
  trying to reach it.
- **The render task hierarchy** (source in `3119425`, its 1,215-line test file in
  `9f34cff`): `RenderTask`, `MapRenderTask`, `CombinedRenderTask`, `MapUpdateTask`,
  `MapUpdatePreparationTask`, `MapSaveTask`, `MapPurgeTask`, `StorageDeleteTask` and
  `TileUpdateStrategy`.
- **Three defects fixed in the existing `TileUpdateStrategy`.** `fixed(force)` returned a
  fresh object per call instead of the two shared instances, and because
  `WorldRegionUpdateTask` compares its strategy by reference identity — which the render
  manager relies on to recognise a task it already holds — the same region was queued and
  rendered twice. `FORCE_EDGE` was missing outright. None of the three were registered under
  upstream's keys.
- **The config schema half**, which landed early in `packages/config`.

Not fully ported, and so keeping this phase open:

- **The standalone server CLI and its Dockerfile — built on 2026-08-05 (issue #42), still
  short of what upstream's CLI does.** `packages/cli` was a one-line stub with no tests; it
  now mirrors `BlueMapCLI.main()`'s real branching (reusing `@worldlens/config`'s
  `cli/flags.ts` model, not a second copy of it), loads a real config folder the way
  `BlueMapConfigManager` does — writing upstream's own per-file/per-folder defaults, never
  a single-shot dump — resolves real resources through `MinecraftVersion`'s real
  consent-gated download, builds real `BmMap`s over `MCAWorld`/`FileStorage`, drives real
  renders through `RenderDriver`, serves real routes through `packages/server`'s handlers,
  and writes the webapp's real `settings.json` (`WebFilesManager.Settings`, field for
  field). Deliberately deferred, and said so out loud where the CLI is asked for it rather
  than silently doing nothing: `-n`/mod-resource scanning, `resourceExtensions.zip`
  parity and SQL storages in the CLI. Non-box, nested and subtracting render masks closed on
  2026-08-06 with exact local, standalone-CLI and GitHub Actions semantics. (`-u`/`--watch` was deferred
  here too when this paragraph was first written, exiting non-zero and naming issue #40's
  `MapUpdateService` as the still-unwired piece; it closed on 2026-08-06 — see below.)
  3 files, 22 tests (`packages/cli/test`) as of this paragraph's original writing, including
  one end-to-end test that renders a real `packages/worldgen` world through a real resource
  pack and serves it, and a real subprocess spawn of the built `dist/index.js`.
  **`packages/cli/Dockerfile` was built and run for real**, not authored blind: `docker
build -f design/packages/cli/Dockerfile .` from the repository root (`pnpm --filter
"@worldlens/cli..." install`/`build`, then a `pnpm deploy --legacy` prune) produced
  a runtime image that rendered a real `packages/worldgen` world mounted read-only, served
  a real hires tile, `index.html` and `settings.json` over its mapped port, answered a real
  `POST /maps/{id}/update`, and — checked with `docker exec ... id` — runs as `uid=1000
(node)`, never root.

Ported on 2026-08-05 (issue #40), in `packages/server/src/plugin/MapUpdateService.ts`
(`50e4b1a`):

- **The missing middle between a file-system event and a render task.** `WatchService` and
  `MCAWorldRegionWatchService` existed in the engine and `RenderManager`/`RenderDriver`
  existed to drive a render, but nothing joined the two. `MapUpdateService` is a port of
  upstream's `common/plugin/MapUpdateService.java`: it reads batches of changed
  region-positions off a map's `createRegionWatchService()` and, once a region has been
  quiet for a debounce window, constructs a real `WorldRegionUpdateTask` and schedules it on
  a real `RenderManager` — reusing `RenderDriver`'s exact task/scheduling layer rather than
  adding a second one.
- **Both hard parts the issue called out are upstream's own answers, not new inventions.**
  Bursts coalesce because `updateRegion` cancels and replaces whatever timer is already
  pending for a region (upstream's own `max(regionUpdateCooldown - timeSinceLastUpdate,
5000)` delay formula, kept as constructor-overridable options so tests need not sit
  through 5+ real seconds). Dedup needs no new logic at all: every fire constructs
  `new WorldRegionUpdateTask(map, regionPos)` with the shared `TileUpdateStrategy.FORCE_NONE`
  singleton, so `RenderManager.scheduleRenderTask`'s own equals-based queue-containment
  refuses a region already queued — and a region already **at the head** (i.e. currently
  being worked on) is deliberately _not_ refused, so a new event for it queues safely behind
  the running one instead of racing or being dropped, verified against the real
  `RenderManager`'s queue rather than assumed.
- **Tests are against real fixtures throughout** (`packages/server/test/map-update-service
.test.ts`, 8 tests): a real `packages/worldgen`-generated world's real region file,
  touched, schedules exactly its own region; a real chokidar-backed watch service (not a
  mock) drives every burst/coalescing/cooldown/head-of-queue/error-surfacing case, the last
  proven with a live `process.on('unhandledRejection')` guard that never fires.
- **Wired into `packages/cli` on 2026-08-06 — see the dated block immediately below.** At
  the time this bullet was written, that package was mid-restructure by a different task in
  the same pass this landed in, so the bridge stopped at a clean `start()`/`close()` API
  (`new MapUpdateService(renderManager, map).start()` per watched map,
  `await service.close()` on shutdown) rather than fighting over a file someone else was
  actively editing. The CLI hookup itself is closed now.

Ported on 2026-08-06 (issue #40's CLI half, closed), in `packages/cli`:

- **`-u`/`--watch` now does what it always claimed to.** `packages/cli/src/render.ts` drops
  `EXIT_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` and adds `startWatchers()`, returning a `RunningWatch` (`services`,
  `fullUpdateTimer`, `close()`); `runRender()` now also returns its resolved `targets` so the
  caller can hand the same resolved map list to the watcher rather than re-resolving it. It
  ports upstream's `vendor/BlueMap/implementations/cli/src/main/java/de/bluecolored/bluemap
/cli/BlueMapCLI.java`'s `if (watch) {...}` block (~lines 102-118) and its
  `updateAllMapsTask` periodic-timer block (~lines 182-197) — one `MapUpdateService` per
  targeted map, reusing the already-ported `packages/server/src/plugin/MapUpdateService.ts`
  as-is, with none of its watcher/debounce/dedup logic reimplemented.
- **`packages/cli/src/cli.ts`**: `CliResult` gained `watch: RunningWatch | null`; the old
  exit-3 branch for `-u` now calls `startWatchers(...)`, reading `core.conf`'s
  `update-cooldown` (seconds → ms) and `full-update-interval` (minutes → ms).
  `EXIT_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` is gone from the `EXIT` table entirely.
- **`packages/cli/src/index.ts`**'s `shutdown()` closes `result.watch` first, mirroring
  upstream's `shutdown` runnable (`BlueMapCLI.java:206`); the keep-alive branch now triggers
  on `result.server !== null || result.watch !== null`.
- **Tests**: `packages/cli/test/fixtures/fakeMap.ts` (new) — fake `BmMap`/`World` builder
  plus a blocking `WatchService`; `packages/cli/test/render-watch.test.ts` (new, 6 tests) —
  one service per map and started, per-map skip-on-throw still watching the rest, the timer
  existing only when `full-update-interval > 0` and re-triggering every target when fired,
  no timer at 0, idempotent `close()`, and the periodic timer using `FORCE_NONE`.
  `packages/cli/test/e2e.test.ts` gained one real end-to-end case: `runCli(["-c",
configFolder, "-u"])` renders, exits 0, returns a non-null `watch`, then a real region file
  is touched and a real render is proven scheduled from it — asserted on the `"Scheduled
update for region-file:"` log line rather than a queue count, since the live worker pool
  drains the task before a count taken after the touch can observe it (a race found and
  fixed in this session).
- **Two honest deviations, found and left alone rather than silently patched:**
    1. **Queue priority is not upstream's.** Upstream's `updateAllMapsTask` calls
       `renderManager.scheduleRenderTasksNext(...)`, jumping the queue; this port's periodic
       timer goes through `RenderDriver.triggerUpdate` → `scheduleRenderTask(...)`, a normal
       tail-enqueue. Upstream's periodic full-refresh therefore jumps ahead of a backlog of
       pending region updates; this port's queues behind it. **Pre-existing, not introduced
       here** — `runRender`'s own initial-render call has the identical characteristic, and
       nothing in `packages/server` calls `scheduleRenderTaskNext`/`scheduleRenderTasksNext`
       anywhere today. Needs a decision (add a "Next" path to `RenderDriver`, or document the
       simplification), recorded rather than picked unilaterally.
    2. **Exception granularity, currently unreachable.** Upstream distinguishes `IOException`
       (logged as an error) from `UnsupportedOperationException` ("not supported for the
       world-type", logged as a warning) when a watcher fails to construct; `startWatchers`
       collapses both into one `catch` that always logs an error. `MCAWorld
.createRegionWatchService()` never throws and is the only real `World` implementation
       in this port, so the path is dead today.

Verification for this block: `pnpm --filter @worldlens/cli run typecheck` clean;
`npx eslint packages/cli` clean (after fixing one real `prefer-const` error the change
introduced); `npx vitest run packages/cli` — **29 passed, 0 skipped, 4 test files**; `npx
vitest run packages/server` — **42 passed** (`MapUpdateService` untouched). Both
`webappBundleBuilt`-gated e2e tests ran for real after `npm install && npm run build` in
`vendor/BlueMap/common/webapp`; the new `-u` test took roughly 9s and its log carries
`Scheduled update for region-file: (0, 0) (Map: overworld)`. Both guard tests were confirmed
to actually guard by breaking them on purpose and restoring: removing the per-map try/catch
turned the skip test red, and changing `> 0` to `>= 0` turned the no-timer test red. **CI
has not run against this change yet.**

Ported on 2026-08-05 (issue #41), in `packages/server/`:

- **The full HTTP routes and server-sent events.** `packages/server` was four files: a
  static handler, an HTTP server, the remote proxy and the index. Three commits added a
  fifth and sixth handler and a live-data layer alongside them, extending rather than
  rewriting the four: `MapStorageHandler.ts` (`d78bbbc`) ports
  `MapStorageRequestHandler.java`'s tile/settings/textures/assets routes and its exact
  gzip-negotiation rules against a real `MapStorage`; `SseConnectionManager.ts` and
  `LiveDataBroadcaster.ts` (`00261d4`) port `SseConnection`/`SseConnectionManager`/
  `LiveDataSupplierBroadcaster.java` — real Server-Sent Events, confirmed from the Java
  rather than assumed, since `MapRequestHandler.java` is the only upstream web file
  mentioning `text/event-stream`. `live/players.json` and `live/markers.json` answer with
  upstream's own empty shape (`{"players":[]}`, `{}`) rather than 404ing, honest stubs since
  local live-player tracking is still Phase I. `design/docs/deviations.md` now carries the
  formal entry for this phase's two intentional additions under "Server package
  (`packages/server`)": the `/maps/{id}/update` trigger below, and the
  `res.flushHeaders()` fix the SSE tests caught — Node buffers response headers until the
  first write, and nothing forced a flush on connect.

Not proven, made less true on 2026-08-05 (issue #29, landed with #41 above):

- **Something outside `packages/engine` now calls the render manager.**
  `packages/server/src/render/RenderDriver.ts` (`19103df`) constructs a real
  `MapUpdateTask` (via upstream's own `MapUpdatePreparationTask.updateMap`) and schedules it
  on a real `RenderManager`, exercised by a test that is not mocked at any layer
  `packages/engine`'s own `rendertasks.test.ts` leaves mocked — it drives a real
  `HiresModelManager` and reads real tiles back from a real `FileMapStorage`. A second test
  added on 2026-08-05 (issue #29, `packages/cli` work) closes the specific gap that one left
  open: it loads a real `packages/worldgen`-generated world through the real `MCAWorld.load`
  anvil reader, meshes it against a real (self-authored) `ResourcePack` loaded off a real
  directory, and asserts real hires tiles appeared in a real `FileMapStorage` — exactly what
  issue #29's own "done" checklist asks for, at the scale ("a tiny world is fine") it asks
  for. What is still true, and deliberately: local rendering still goes through upstream's
  Java engine per D17; the desktop app was not switched over to this driver, on purpose —
  that remains a separate, explicit piece of work issue #29 itself calls out of scope.
- **Both known differences from upstream in `WorldRegionUpdateTask` are now fixed.**
  Upstream's periodic 60-second `map.save` was implemented first, as `saveIfDue(60_000)` at
  completion. The second — `run()` calling `complete()` even for a region with nothing to
  do, writing chunk hashes upstream would not, observable only on an incremental re-render
  — was fixed on 2026-08-05 (issue #28): `run()` now returns before `#complete()` on the
  no-op path. Both fixes are proven by the full byte-exact oracle run to completion at both
  sizes after the second fix landed: the 200x200 fixture compared 63 files identically and
  the 1000x1000 fixture compared 995 files identically, including all 961 hires tiles, plus
  the 1.12.2 legacy check (14/14) since it depends on the same region-completion code.

Ported on 2026-08-05 (issue #30), in `packages/engine/src/map/rendermanager/serialization/`:

- **`SerializableRenderTask`, the polymorphic `RenderTaskAdapter`, `BmMapAdapter` and
  `Vector2iAdapter`** — upstream's four `serialization/` files, ported onto this package's
  own `@worldlens/nbt` (BlueNBT) implementation rather than JSON, matching upstream's
  on-disk shape. `RenderTaskAdapter` dispatches by a stable `{ type, data }` key
  (`map-purge`/`map-save`/`map-update`/`region-update`, upstream's own keys); an unknown
  `type` on read is refused with a readable `IOException` rather than guessed at.
  `BmMapAdapter` resolves a saved map id against a live `maps` set handed in by the caller —
  a name that no longer exists fails clearly instead of silently rendering nothing. One
  upstream bug was fixed rather than reproduced: `BmMapAdapter`'s not-found branch calls
  `reader.nextString()` a second time to build its own error message, which would corrupt
  the reader's position; the port reads the id once and reuses it.
- **Each task's `Serialized` form** — `MapPurgeTaskSerialized`, `MapSaveTaskSerialized`,
  `MapUpdateTaskSerialized`, `WorldRegionUpdateTaskSerialized` — added beside their tasks
  in the existing files, each with its own `ObjectSchema` (this port's stand-in for
  upstream's reflection) and a `deserialize()` that refuses a truncated/missing required
  field with an `IOException` instead of building a half-formed task. `MapUpdateTask`'s
  carries its full sub-task list and `currentTaskIndex`, so a resumed update skips every
  already-finished region rather than re-running it — the same checkpoint granularity
  upstream's own `Serialized` gives, no finer: a region that was mid-render when the process
  stopped restarts that region's tiles from the top on resume, because neither this port nor
  upstream saves the tile cursor.
- **Whole-queue persistence**: `saveRenderTaskQueue`/`loadRenderTaskQueue`
  (`RenderTaskQueueStorage.ts`), written and read through this package's own
  atomic-write convention (`<file>.filepart` then rename, `util/FileHelper.ts`) rather than
  upstream's `FileHelper.createFilepartOutputStream`. The file carries an explicit format
  `version`; a version that does not match, or a top-level structure that fails to parse at
  all (a genuinely truncated write), is refused and deleted wholesale rather than
  half-applied. A task with no `Serialized` form at all (`StorageDeleteTask`,
  `MapUpdatePreparationTask`) is filtered out _before_ the list is written — writing it
  through the shared `LenientListAdapter`'s per-element skip, the way upstream's own
  `RenderTaskAdapter`/`LenientListAdapter` pairing would, commits to the pre-filter element
  count in the nbt stream and produces a corrupt file if any element writes nothing; this is
  closed at the one call site that matters rather than carried forward unverified from the
  Java. Individual bad entries elsewhere in the queue (an unloaded map, an unknown type) are
  still dropped one at a time and reported, exactly as upstream's own `LenientListAdapter`
  usage does.
- **`RenderManager.saveRenderTaskQueue`/`.loadRenderTaskQueue`** — thin methods added to
  `RenderManager.ts` itself (upstream has no equivalent; `Plugin#save`/`Plugin#load` reach
  directly for `getScheduledRenderTasks()`/`scheduleRenderTasks()`) purely so "can the
  render manager write its own queue out and read it back" — the issue's own wording — does
  not require knowing a separate module exists. Loading goes through
  `scheduleRenderTasks`, so the manager's own containment rule still applies to a restored
  task exactly as it would to a freshly-built one — including the documented exemption for
  whatever sits at the head, which a dedicated test exercises deliberately rather than
  fighting.
- **Round trip is the test, 19 of them** (`RenderTaskSerialization.test.ts`): every adapter
  and every task type serialize-then-deserialize back to a functionally identical task,
  including `TileUpdateStrategy` identity — a deserialized `fixed(true)` is asserted `.toBe`
  the shared `FORCE_ALL` singleton, not merely `.equal`, which is exactly the bug this
  repository's own history already produced once (see the `TileUpdateStrategy` entry
  above). A dedicated resume-after-crash test drives a two-region `MapUpdateTask` partway
  into its second region, serializes it, restores it against a _freshly constructed_ `BmMap`
  over the same on-disk storage (not the same in-memory object — a genuine simulated
  restart), and proves by tile coordinate that the finished region is never touched again
  while the interrupted one is fully re-rendered from scratch. A further pair drives a real
  `RenderManager` end to end: schedule real tasks, save through the manager, restore into a
  fresh one, and confirm a task already queued behind the head is correctly refused rather
  than duplicated. The existing `rendertasks.test.ts`/`RenderManager.test.ts`/
  `ProgressTracker.test.ts` suites are untouched at 110 tests; `rendermanager/`'s own total
  is now 129.
- **Not this**: the app's own resumable-render machinery for GitHub Actions renders
  (`docs/resumable-renders.md`) is unrelated and untouched — that survives a crash by
  remembering which shards finished, not by serializing an engine `RenderTask` queue.
  `RenderManager` can now save and load its own queue, but nothing yet _calls_ either method
  from a running process — no periodic-save timer, no load-on-startup wiring into
  `packages/server` or `packages/cli`. Wiring that in (upstream's `Plugin#load`/`Plugin#save`,
  on a timer and at shutdown) remains open, tracked separately from this issue's own scope.

## Delivery, which the plan never described

None of this is in `plan.md`, because the plan assumed a single desktop application rendering
locally in TypeScript. All of it is on the branch and tested.

| **Rendering in GitHub Actions** | Worlds too large for one job split across a matrix, in sequential waves past the 256-job cap. 961 of 961 tiles byte-identical to an unsharded reference, zero differences across 6,024,024 lowres pixels. **Issue #39, closed 2026-08-05:** the wave ceiling was hardcoded at 6 (1,536 shards max); it is now 12 (3,072 shards), driven by the plan rather than a constant, with a test that reads `render-world.yml` itself and fails if the declared wave jobs and `RENDER_WAVE_SLOTS` disagree. A new early disk-requirement check measures the runner's actual free disk against the plan's estimate and fails with a named limit before any wave dispatches, rather than letting a runner die mid-render. 73/73 tests pass. **Its wave dispatch is now genuinely proven, not just arithmetic:** a real 361-region world was dispatched through the hosted workflow and used exactly the two waves the plan predicted, watched to completion. **Still open, named rather than implied closed:** that same run's _merge_ step across the two waves was never reached (the world was reused for issue #44's staging test instead, which is how issue #47's hyphenated-map-id bug was found), and the disk check has still only been exercised by a world needing ~6 GiB against ~84 GiB free — nowhere near the ceiling the issue was opened over.

| **Backups**                     | A world or a rendered map packed, split and published as the assets of a new GitHub release, with a pointer naming every part and its SHA-256 (`8cbac63`, `docs/backup.md`). The pointer format conforms to Desktop Material's Cheap LFS v1 rather than a rival format. Restore verifies each part and the whole file; an upload that stopped before its pointer went up is listed as unfinished and offered no restore. Git LFS was rejected on cost, by name. This is **format conformance, permanently** — checked against a fixture copy of the canonical patterns — and **not** interoperability: no round trip through the other application has been run in either direction. Settled as issue #36's Outcome B; see `docs/backup.md`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

All of it is built and unit tested; what is **not** claimed is a hosted CI verdict or a
runtime capture, both of which are stated separately below.

A world fetched from any GitHub release, including one split into parts held in a different repository, with per-part and whole-file digests. The part size is a bounded choice of 500 MB, 1 GB or 1.7 GB (`3119425`) rather than a constant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Focused seam/UI tests, a production UI build, and a cheap headless 390 CSS-pixel proof pass; a packaged real-host fetch remains unverified.                                                   |

Focused main/preload/mounted/policy tests and a production build pass. Docker Desktop's client was present but its `desktop-linux` daemon pipe was absent, so a real container or volume fetch remains unverified. |

A project is the document the app edits — its maps, its storages, its settings — and the wizard is the quick way to make one rather than the only way in. Project saves are snapshotted by the same version history the config folders use, under their own repository root. `92c392f` fixed a projects-list adapter that read a result union as if it were the payload                                                                                                                |

It is also the cause of the last red CI run: `f4d3abd` committed the _import_ of `../console/annotations.js` into `renderRun.ts` while the console files themselves stayed untracked until `897ecad`, three commits later, so the hosted checkout at `80369ec` had an importer and no file to import                                                                                                                                               |

## Phase J, what is built and what is proven

Built, unit tested and on the branch, in `packages/app/src/main/`:

- `java/` — JVM discovery (`JAVA_HOME`, then `PATH`, then the app's own copy, every
  candidate _run_ rather than trusted by path), version checking against upstream's
  `JavaLanguageVersion.of(25)` pin, Adoptium metadata resolution, a resumable SHA-256
  verified download, staged extraction, and jar resolution for all seven implementations
  in both a packaged app and a checkout.
- `render/` — the config writer (every path absolute, HOCON strings escaped through
  `JSON.stringify`), the child-process runner and its cancellation path, the CLI log and
  progress parser, the orchestrator (consent checked first, before anything is spawned),
  the `render.json` provenance record, and `LocalMapHandler`, which serves a finished
  render to the viewer exactly as the remote proxy serves a remote one.
- `consent.ts` — the Mojang download decision: asked once at first launch, remembered
  forever, never asked again.

Since this section was first written, two of its four gaps have closed. What is proven now:

- **All seven jars are built by CI and attached to every release.**
  `.github/workflows/build-jars.yml`, called from `ci.yml`, compiles them from the
  `vendor/BlueMap` submodule at `e664c1a`. Release `v0.1.0-build.196` carries all seven with
  their SHA-256 digests.
- **CI renders a test world with the Java engine on every green run.** `ci.yml` has a
  `Generate and render a test world` job that generates a world with `worldgen`, renders it
  with the CLI jar, records what rendered it, and hands the result to the screenshot job.

What is still **not** proven, and so keeps this phase honest:

- The desktop app's own end-to-end flow has been driven by hand on one Windows machine. It
  has not run on macOS or on Linux.
- JDK provisioning is proven against the real network on Windows: real Adoptium metadata,
  a real Temurin `jdk-25.0.4+7` archive (141,164,204 bytes) downloaded, its real SHA-256
  verified, extracted, and the extracted binary run and reporting `25.0.4`, with discovery
  blinded so the provisioning branch genuinely ran. Digest refusal and mid-transfer resume
  are proven too. Still unproven: the same path driven from the `Download Java` button in a
  packaged build, and anything outside Windows. The proof is opt-in
  (`MBM_REAL_JDK_DOWNLOAD=1`), so CI does not run it.
- The 961-tile render was produced by invoking the jar directly. Reproducing it through
  the app's own orchestrator, from a render request to tiles the viewer opens, has not
  been captured as evidence.
- No adapter jar has been loaded by a real Minecraft server. They are built and published;
  nobody has run one.

## Phase C, what is done and what is not

Every file in upstream's `resources` package is ported and tested: the VFS, `Pack` with its
five-step mount and reverse-order overlays, both `pack.mcmeta` eras, `MinecraftVersion` with
a streamed SHA-1 and a defaultless accept-download gate, `DataPack`, the
blockstate/model/texture/entitystate data classes including the coordinate-seeded variant
PRNG, the `ResourcePack` orchestrator with its five phases and texture filter, the seven-file
atlas layer, and `TextureGallery` with `textures.json`.

**2026-08-05: all three exit checks have now actually run (issue #31). Check 1 passes for
both vanilla and modded, check 3 passes, and check 2's render defect is fixed (#46,
closed) — issue #31 itself is now closed.** "Ported" undersold it; see below for exactly
what each check proved.

- **Check 1, `textures.json` semantic parity — PASS, vanilla and modded.**
  `tools/oracle/textures-parity.mjs` (`--accept-download`) pins Minecraft 1.21, renders a
  minimal world with both engines against the same downloaded-and-verified jar, and diffs
  their `textures.json` with the existing semantic comparator (`tools/oracle/lib/textures.mjs`
  — every field but the image and the entry order compared exactly, the embedded PNG on
  decoded pixels per decision D3): **1723 of 1723 gallery entries agree** for vanilla alone,
  the only differences pixel-identical PNG re-encodes. Two small oracle-harness bugs
  (`render-ts.mjs`'s `version.json` key handling; `renderReference`'s missing version-pin
  parameter) were found and fixed along the way — not port bugs.

    **The modded half closed offline, `--synthetic-modded`.** No legitimate real modded pack
    is reachable under this task's Mojang-only network policy, and none is committed to this
    repository — that has not changed. What changed is that the modded half no longer needs
    one: `tools/oracle/fixtures/syntheticModPack.mjs` builds a small, fully synthetic
    resource pack — a new `testmod:` namespace (two blocks: blockstate, block model, item
    model, texture apiece) plus an override of `minecraft:block/stone`'s texture — entirely
    in code, the same way `packages/engine/test/fixtures/vanillaShapedPack.ts` builds its own
    fixture rather than shipping anything from Mojang. `--synthetic-modded` mounts it as an
    extra, higher-priority resource-pack root on **both** engines (the java side via its own
    `packs/` folder — `BlueMapService#getPackRoots` — the ts side via `render-ts.mjs`'s
    pre-existing `--resource-pack`, which had the right precedence but no caller until now)
    and re-runs the same semantic comparison: **1725 of 1725 entries agree** (1723 vanilla +
    the pack's 2 new textures), and — the check that actually matters here, since a stale
    vanilla `minecraft:block/stone` would still "agree" between two unmodded engines — every
    one of the pack's 3 texture keys was decoded on **both** sides and its top-left pixel
    matched the pack's own known colour exactly: the two new-namespace textures, and the
    override (proving the higher-priority pack root genuinely shadowed the vanilla jar's own
    stone texture, not merely that the resource key still existed). Closed as
    [#31](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/material-bluemap/issues/31) with this
    evidence; a real third-party pack remains a stronger proof if one is ever legitimately
    reachable, but this closes the code-path gap the check exists to catch.

- **Check 2, a 1.12.2 jar through the legacy compat path — PASS, including the render on
  top of it (the defect below is fixed).** `resourcepack-e2e.test.ts`'s new "Proof 4" downloads a
  real 1.12.2 client jar directly from the version manifest (`MinecraftVersion.load` clamps
  any pre-1.13 request up to 1.13 by design, so it cannot be the download vehicle here),
  discovers that **a real client jar carries no `pack.mcmeta` at all** (checked against
  three real jars), supplies the one missing file as a companion root the way a real
  deployment's `packs/` folder would, and proves `LegacyResourcePackExtension` then resolves
  five real pre-flattening blockstates (`stone`, `dirt`, `oak_planks`, `grass`,
  `snow_layer`) to real vanilla texture pixels. That part is a clean pass. But
  `tools/oracle/render-1-12-era-matched.mjs` (new) renders the same 1.12.2 world against
  that real era-matched pack and finds `BlockStateModelRenderer.ts`'s
  `flattenLegacyBlockState` still fires unconditionally on the world's era regardless of the
  pack's — rewriting an already-correct `minecraft:grass` into `minecraft:grass_block` (a
  name that did not exist pre-flattening), which the era pack cannot resolve, so the block
  is silently skipped rather than drawn: zero grass-family texture vertices, and
  `minecraft:blocks/dirt` at 43.6% of the render vs 4.3% in the modern-pack control on the
  identical world — the same "ground no longer occluded" signature this table was written to
  fix, now reproduced the other direction. `podzol`'s rule only injects a property rather
  than renaming the key and is unaffected. This closes the "era-matched resource pack
  untested" gap in this file's earlier legacy-render section with a real answer, and that
  answer was a bug — filed as
  [#46](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/material-bluemap/issues/46) and **fixed and
  closed the same day**: `BlockStateModelRenderer#renderModel` and
  `ExtendedBlock#getProperties` now gate the rename on both eras (world pre-flattening
  **and** pack not pre-flattening, via a new `ResourcePack#isLegacy()`), and
  `render-1-12-era-matched.mjs` asserts on the fix rather than only logging it: grass-family
  texture vertices went from 0 to 91,944 and `minecraft:blocks/dirt` exposure from 43.6% to
  10.2% of the render (modern-pack control: 4.3%), with `render-1-12.mjs`'s 14/14 modern-pack
  checks and `compare.mjs`'s byte-identical modern-world gate both untouched.
- **Check 3, the live end-to-end resolution — PASS.** This check already had a working,
  committed implementation ("Proof 2" in `resourcepack-e2e.test.ts`) — the issue's finding
  was that it had genuinely never been _run_ with the consent flags set. It has now been
  run for real: a freshly downloaded, SHA-1-verified 1.21 client jar resolves
  `minecraft:grass_block[snowy=false]` blockstate → variant → model → parent chain → every
  face's texture → real, non-missing decoded pixels. 12/12 tests passed.

Verification for this section: `BLUEMAP_E2E_DOWNLOAD=1 BLUEMAP_ACCEPT_DOWNLOAD=1 npx vitest
run packages/engine/test/resourcepack-e2e.test.ts` — **13 passed**; `node
tools/oracle/textures-parity.mjs --accept-download` — **PASS, 1723/1723 (vanilla)**; `node
tools/oracle/textures-parity.mjs --accept-download --synthetic-modded` — **PASS,
1725/1725, every one of the synthetic pack's 3 texture keys pixel-verified on both
engines**; `node tools/oracle/render-1-12-era-matched.mjs --accept-download` — **PASS**,
2/2 structural checks plus the two era-matrix assertions (grass-family vertices nonzero,
dirt fraction near the modern-pack control).

## Phase H, SQL storages: what is ported and what is not

Ported on 2026-08-05 (issue #32), in `packages/engine/src/storage/sql/`: `SQLStorage`,
`SQLMapStorage`, `SQLGridStorage`, `SQLItemStorage`, `Database` and the four-dialect
registry (`MySQL`, `MariaDB` — sharing `MySQLCommandSet`, exactly as upstream's
`Dialect.java` shares one `Impl` between them — `PostgreSQL`, `SQLite`), implementing the
same `Storage`/`MapStorage`/`GridStorage`/`ItemStorage` interfaces `FileStorage` already
does. Every dialect's SQL text is transcribed verbatim from `AbstractCommandSet.java` and
the three `*CommandSet.java` files, checked by a 90-assertion statement-for-statement
contract test rather than eyeballed. `packages/engine/src/storage/StorageFactory.ts` is
new: the seam that turns a parsed `FileStorageConfig`/`SqlStorageConfig` from
`@worldlens/config` into a real, working `Storage` — before this, nothing built an
SQL storage from config at all, which was the defect issue #32 opened over.

Drivers are optional dependencies (`sql.js`, `mysql2`, `pg` — all pure JavaScript/WASM, no
native N-API code, consistent with the packaging constraint fixed in `e976ee9`), loaded
through a non-literal dynamic `import()` so esbuild cannot inline them into the app
bundle; a missing driver raises `MissingSqlDriverError` naming the package rather than
surfacing a raw module-resolution stack trace.

**Proven, with a real (WASM) SQLite engine**, not a hand-rolled fake: item and grid
round trips, gzip compression byte-identical between two independent compress calls
(Node's `zlib.gzip` embeds no timestamp), paging past 1000 rows for both grid tiles and
map ids, purge across multiple 1000-row rounds with monotonic progress, real file
persistence across a storage reopen, `StorageDeleteTask` wired against `SQLMapStorage`
exactly as it already is against `FileMapStorage`, and byte-for-byte identical hires
`.prbm.gz` tiles between file storage and SQL storage using the engine's own real PRBM
oracle fixtures (the same tiles `PRBMWriter.test.ts` checks against the real Java writer).

**Proven against real servers, 2026-08-05** (`SqlStorage.realServer.test.ts`, opt-in via
`MBM_TEST_MYSQL_URL`/`MBM_TEST_MARIADB_URL`/`MBM_TEST_POSTGRES_URL`, loudly skipped by
name when unset): three throwaway, official, exact-tag-pinned Docker containers —
`mysql:8.4.6`, `mariadb:11.4.7`, `postgres:17.6` — each on its own high local port with a
freshly generated throwaway password, torn down after the run. Against each: schema
creation on a bare database, an item and grid tile round trip, every oracle-built hires
tile byte-identical to `FileMapStorage`'s own compressed and decompressed bytes (the
same PRBM oracle fixtures the SQLite/byte-fidelity suites use), the three render-state
grids independent of the map's tile compression, purging past a single 1000-row page
with monotonic progress reaching 1, `StorageDeleteTask` wiring, the find-or-create
deleted-map-row-recreation behaviour, and paginating grid tiles past a single page —
**21 tests, all passing, on all three dialects.**

**One real finding, from running against a real server rather than a synthetic one, and
fixed in the port (not the test):** a real MySQL 8.4.6 server rejects any statement sent
through mysql2's server-side prepared-statement path (`connection.execute()`) whose
`LIMIT`/`OFFSET` clause is itself a bound `?` parameter — exactly the shape
`AbstractCommandSet`'s paginated `listMapGrids`/`listMapIds`/`purgeMapGrids` statements
have — with `ER_WRONG_ARGUMENTS` / "Incorrect arguments to mysqld_stmt_execute",
regardless of the bound value's JS type. A real MariaDB 11.4.7 server, same driver, same
SQL text, does not hit this. `MySqlDriver.ts` now uses `connection.query()` (client-side
value escaping, still safe against injection, proven byte-identical for BLOB payloads
against the real server) for every statement instead of `execute()`, which resolved it
on both MySQL and MariaDB without touching any SQL text — see the doc comment on
`MySqlDriverAdapter` for the full account.

**Cross-compatibility with upstream's Java engine — proven, 2026-08-05, issue #32's last
open acceptance item, closed.** `tools/oracle/sql-crosscompat.mjs`, both directions,
against a real `mariadb:11.4.7` Docker container (the same tag `SqlStorage.realServer.test.ts`
already validated), the standard oracle fixture world at the gate's own default size
(seed 1, 1000×1000 — the same world `compare.mjs` renders for the Phase D gate):

- **Java writes, TS reads.** Upstream's own CLI (`vendor/BlueMap/implementations/cli`
  built unmodified) rendered the fixture straight into SQL storage
  (`storage-type: sql`, `dialect: mariadb`, a real MariaDB Connector/J 3.5.3 driver jar
  resolved from Maven Central via `tools/oracle/driver-fetch`). This port's `SQLStorage`
  then read every tile and render-state grid back out over a real `mysql2` connection and
  compared it against a Java-rendered **file storage** control of the identical world:
  **961/961 hires tiles**, **24/24 lowres tiles** (16 + 4 + 4 across the three LODs), and
  both metadata documents (`settings.json`, `textures.json`) byte-identical after
  decompression. `chunkState` (a content hash, not a clock reading) byte-identical too.
  `tileState` and `regionState` agreed on every deterministic field and differed only in
  their wall-clock render/update timestamps — expected and correctly excluded, using the
  same `diffRenderState` classification `compare.mjs`'s own Phase D gate already uses (see
  `tools/oracle/lib/renderstate.mjs`), not a relaxed or invented comparison.
- **TS writes, Java reads.** This port's engine rendered the same fixture into a second
  SQL database on the same server. Upstream's own CLI, started in genuine
  **webserver-only** mode (`-w`, no `-r`, no map ever loaded) and configured to serve
  straight out of that SQL storage, served every tile and metadata document back over real
  HTTP through its actual production code path (`MapStorageRequestHandler`'s raw-storage
  route — the same one a real deployment uses to serve a map nobody currently has loaded).
  **961/961 hires tiles**, **24/24 lowres tiles**, both metadata documents: byte-identical
  to what the TS engine itself wrote, fetched back through upstream's real Java.

**Two real findings, both resolved without touching `packages/engine`'s SQL storage
port:**

1. **MariaDB Connector/J does not accept `jdbc:mariadb://user:password@host:port/db`
   embedded userinfo credentials** — the exact URL shape this port's own `mysql2` adapter
   (and MySQL Connector/J) parse correctly — misreading the whole `password@host` segment
   as the port and failing with `SQLException: Incorrect port value`. Confirmed against
   the real driver and a real server, not assumed. This is a genuine MariaDB
   Connector/J behavior, not a port bug: upstream's own `SQLConfig` documents exactly the
   escape hatch for it (`connection-properties`, a `Map<String,String>` merged into the
   JDBC `Properties` object), so the harness's generated upstream config uses a bare
   connection URL plus `connection-properties` for credentials. No SQL storage code
   changed.
2. **A raw byte-diff of `tileState`/`regionState` against a separately-run control render
   is the wrong comparison**, and produces false positives — caught on the harness's own
   first live run, not shipped unnoticed. Both grids embed real wall-clock render/update
   timestamps (upstream: `WorldRegionUpdateTask.java`,
   `(int) (System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000)`), which two independently-run renders
   cannot share. Fixed in the harness (`tools/oracle/sql-crosscompat.mjs`), not the port:
   it now reuses `diffRenderState` from `tools/oracle/lib/renderstate.mjs` — the same
   module the Phase D gate already uses and `selftest.mjs` already covers — instead of a
   new, less-tested comparison.

**Not proven — stated rather than glossed over:**

- **Cross-compatibility for the SQLite and PostgreSQL dialects specifically.** The MariaDB
  proof above exercises the same `SQLGridStorage`/`SQLItemStorage`/`AbstractCommandSet`
  code paths every dialect shares, and MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL are already proven
  against real servers independently (above) — but a Java-CLI-vs-TS-port cross-engine run
  specifically for SQLite or PostgreSQL has not been done. SQLite is not "free" for this
  the way it is for the same-engine tests: upstream ships no bundled SQLite JDBC driver
  either (`core/build.gradle.kts` depends on `commons-dbcp2` only), so proving it would
  need the same `driver-jar`/`driver-class` treatment MariaDB got here (e.g.
  `org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc`), not a "just works, no server needed" shortcut.
- **`driver-jar`/`driver-class`** (a custom JDBC driver jar): there is no javascript
  equivalent of loading an arbitrary classpath jar at runtime, so `StorageFactory` refuses
  a config that sets either, by name, rather than silently ignoring the setting.

commits pushed after `c533c8c` — a UI-defect wave (FAB gutters, a whole-GUI cursor leak, four
ellipsis/tooltip fixes, a docked-panel scroll fix, the Java-render-default decision; see
HANDOFF.md's dated entry near the top of that file) — are queued or in progress on GitHub's
own runners as of this writing, not yet CI-verified; that is a throughput backlog from a high
push rate in a shared checkout, not a known failure. Check `gh run list --branch main --limit
10` for the current truth before trusting either "still red" or "green by now." The
`0bc90c2` figure directly below this paragraph — 469 files, 7,288 tests, 7 failed — is the
superseded, pre-fix count kept for the record of what the four-cause CI repair pass (see
HANDOFF.md) actually fixed; it is not the current state. The per-package breakdown further
below is an older, 2026-08-04-evening figure and is now stale in its totals — the suite grew
by more than a hundred files during the 2026-08-05 pass (`packages/server` and
`packages/cli` in particular went from a handful of tests to real suites; see their own
sections above) — but is kept for package-shape context until a fresh per-package count is
taken. The `CommandPalette.test.ts`/`tabGroupPickerMount.test.ts` failures the `0bc90c2`
figure carries are fixed; see "Hosted CI, the 2026-08-05 pass" above for the four-cause
repair narrative and this file's HANDOFF.md counterpart for the full account of each fix.

**Read the one failure before treating this as a broken tree, and note that it is already
gone.** It was `packages/ui/src/components/confirm/superConfirmPolicy.test.ts`, the guard that
refuses an undeclared destructive action, objecting to
`packages/ui/src/components/remote/remoteTargets.ts` — a file a concurrent session had not
committed yet. That session declared the call twelve minutes later, and the file now passes
its 14 tests on its own; the full suite has not been re-run since, so the totals above are the
earlier figure. The tree is moving fast enough to watch: a run five minutes before that one
reported 353 files and 5,721 tests.

The rule the guard enforces is worth stating plainly, since this is the second time it has
fired: a commit that adds a destructive call site must declare it in `DESTRUCTIVE_FILES` in
that same commit, or CI fails on that commit.

A green suite proves the ported code does what its tests say. It does not prove parity with
upstream, which is what the phase exit criteria above are for.

**The archive-test timeout is fixed.** `packages/app/src/main/backup/archive.test.ts >
survives a file large enough to need more than one read chunk` used to pass on a developer
machine and time out after 5 seconds on the hosted Linux runner (CI run 30927851530). It now
carries an explicit `{ timeout: 60_000 }`, and CI has since gone green on `main` — most
recently run 30935770990 at `0008dd4`, which published `v0.1.0-build.196`.

## Hosted CI, as it actually stands

**Superseded by the 2026-08-05 pass below — this paragraph describes an older window and is
kept only so the `80369ec` cause (a since-fixed import/file split across two commits) is not
lost.** For the current, honest CI state, read the next section instead of this one.

No CI run on `main` produced a verdict for that older tip. The last one that did was
[30943812775](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/material-bluemap/actions/runs/30943812775)
at `80369ec` — **failure**, `Could not resolve "../console/annotations.js" from
"src/components/world/renderRun.ts"` during `pnpm build` of `packages/ui`. The cause is worth
knowing exactly, because it is invisible on a developer machine where the file is simply
present: `f4d3abd` committed the import, and the file it imports was not committed until
`897ecad`, three commits later. `80369ec` sits between them. The console files were tracked
correctly by the time this pass started, and `pnpm --filter @worldlens/ui build`
succeeds locally, so that specific cause is gone — but a _different_ cause has kept every run
in the pass below red, and it is real, not a re-run of this one.

## Hosted CI, the 2026-08-05 pass, as it actually stands

**Green, as of [run 31013825875](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/material-bluemap/actions/runs/31013825875)
on commit `9d8de68` — all seven jobs passed, and it published
[`v0.1.0-build.370`](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/material-bluemap/releases/tag/v0.1.0-build.370).**
That was the pass's _first_ green run, not its latest: several commits landed cleanly on
top of it, and **the last hosted CI run to actually finish is
[run 31023005393](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/material-bluemap/actions/runs/31023005393)
on commit `c533c8c`, also green, publishing
[`v0.1.0-build.378`](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/material-bluemap/releases/tag/v0.1.0-build.378).**
Roughly twenty commits pushed since `c533c8c` are queued or in progress as of this writing,
a throughput backlog rather than a known failure — check `gh run list --branch main --limit
10` before assuming either state for the current tip. The paragraph below this one is kept
for the record of how red CI was before the pass's first green run and why; it describes an
earlier tip and is no longer the current state.

**Superseded record.** No commit across most of this multi-agent pass produced a green
hosted CI run. The last CI run on `main` that had succeeded before this pass was
[30935770990](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/material-bluemap/actions/runs/30935770990)
on commit `0008dd4` (`v0.1.0-build.196`). The cause was a real, locally-reproducible test
failure, not hosted-runner-only flakiness: run
[30986840852](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/material-bluemap/actions/runs/30986840852)
on commit `e976ee9` — the native-module fix expected to finally clear the way to green —
still came back **failure**, for a different reason than the one it fixed: two recurring
Vuetify-rendering assertion failures, `packages/ui/src/components/palette/
CommandPalette.test.ts` ("the Debug row should render a switch, not a label") and
`packages/ui/src/components/tabs/tabGroupPickerMount.test.ts` (a button rendering the wrong
label/icon), plus a `[vitest-worker]: Timeout calling "onTaskUpdate"` unhandled error. Every
CI run checked after it — `d948635`, `6981bf9`, `50e4b1a`, `2b86de9`, `a5e5cf7`, `d4f83fa`,
`8f61600`, `53e6474`, `cbc135c`, `0bc90c2` — also came back **failure**, all for the same
recurring pair. A full local `npx vitest run` at `0bc90c2` reproduced the same shape: 469
files, 7,288 tests, 7,278 passed, 3 skipped, **7 failed**, in ~225s.

**What actually fixed it — four separate, unrelated causes, each found against a real
failing run and fixed one at a time (full account in HANDOFF.md's "CI goes green for the
first time in this pass" entry):**

1. An i18n warning flood (`e77f11a`) tripping vitest's own 60-second worker/main RPC
   heartbeat — not a test assertion. ~70 test files intentionally mount `vue-i18n` with an
   empty message table; about half never silenced the resulting warning, and one run's log
   was 93% `[intlify] Not found` noise crossing the same IPC channel the heartbeat rides on.
2. The heartbeat flake still recurred under runner contention even after the flood was
   silenced; a retry wrapper (`3791655`) now retries only when a run's summary shows zero
   real test/file failures. The same commit found and fixed a real, separate esbuild bug the
   fix exposed: `pngjs`'s unconditional `require("util")` throws under esbuild's ESM
   `__require` shim, invisible until `check` could finally get past step 1 to reach the job
   that packages the app.
3. Two settings-history state-isolation bugs (`e569e47`, `cfab9a1`, `a1f8172`, `2a06e19`):
   `eulaStorage.ts` and four sibling stores called their history-mirror function _after_ a
   `storage === null` early return, silently skipping the one case the mirror exists to be
   independent of; `MarkerMenu.test.ts` had no `localStorage` stand-in of its own and
   silently inherited another test file's state when the two shared a vitest worker.
4. The Screenshots job's own EULA panel has a permanently-hidden duplicate mount
   (`EulaSurface`'s always-mounted `EulaViewer.vue`); an unscoped `.mb-eula` wait matched
   that twin instead of the real dialog and could never resolve (`3dc7ef5`). Fixing that
   exposed two more real, previously-never-reported bugs that had always been silently
   skipped in a worker some earlier failure discarded first: a collapsed Appearance-editor
   tab strip and a stale active-tab assumption in the changelog capture (`9d8de68`).

The dedicated "Lint the workflow files" job (a separate `actionlint` step) was green on
every run checked throughout — it was specifically the `Lint, build, test` and Screenshots
jobs that were red, for the reasons above.

## Revealed by the 2026-08-04 work, now resolved

Kept for the record; every item below was open when this section was first written and is
closed now. See the 2026-08-05 HANDOFF.md entry for the evidence behind each.

- ~~Drive the render manager from something.~~ **Done (issues #29/#41).**
  `packages/server/src/render/RenderDriver.ts` constructs a real `MapUpdateTask` and drives
  it through a real `RenderManager`, proven against a real `packages/worldgen` world and a
  real resource pack. Local rendering still goes through the Java engine per D17, on
  purpose — that is a separate, explicit switch, not this item.
- ~~Decide whether to match upstream's empty-region completion semantics~~ **Done (issue
  #28).** `WorldRegionUpdateTask.run()` now returns before `#complete()` on a no-op region,
  matching upstream; the incremental parity check was re-run at both oracle sizes and both
  report identical output.
- **The first-class screen capture gate is now complete.** `packages/app/test/screenshots.spec.ts`
  photographs History, Projects, the CI-render screen and the EULA viewer as required local
  surfaces, and records the render console as an explicit runtime-dependent gap when no render
  is in flight. The captions name the real state instead of substituting a mock screen.
- ~~Extend the version history past config folders and projects~~ **Done (issue #35).**
  Server profiles and application settings are now snapshotted; the maps-and-servers list is
  covered by the same profiles history, per the issue's own text that it is one store viewed
  two ways.
- **The options editor inventory is pinned.** `configSearch.test.ts` now asserts the generated
  workspace exposes 154 settings across the seven configuration tabs, with History as the
  eighth navigation tab, so a schema change cannot quietly make the published screenshot and
  README lie.

## Open going into the next pass

The GitHub issue board is at **zero open issues** as of this writing (37 closed in total,
`#3` through `#47`, with gaps where a number was never opened as an issue). Nothing below is
tracked by an open issue; each item is named here so it is not lost between passes.

- **Wire `RenderManager.saveRenderTaskQueue`/`.loadRenderTaskQueue` into something that
  actually calls them** — a periodic-save timer and load-on-startup, in `packages/server`
  or `packages/cli` (issue #30's own follow-on, not closed by it).
- ~~Join `packages/cli`'s `-u`/`--watch` to `packages/server`'s `MapUpdateService`~~ **Done
  (issue #40's CLI half, 2026-08-06).** See "Phase E, what is ported and what is not" above
  for the detail, including two upstream deviations recorded rather than silently fixed:
  the periodic full-refresh tail-enqueues instead of jumping the queue like upstream's does,
  and a watcher-construction exception path that is upstream-only-distinguished but
  currently unreachable in this port.
- **Prove SQLite and PostgreSQL cross-compatibility with upstream's real Java engine
  specifically.** Issue #32 itself is closed: MariaDB has the real cross-engine proof, both
  directions, and MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL are independently proven against real same-engine
  Docker servers. What has not been done is the Java-CLI-vs-TS-port cross-engine run for
  SQLite or PostgreSQL specifically — SQLite needs the same `driver-jar`/`driver-class`
  treatment MariaDB got here, since upstream ships no bundled SQLite JDBC driver either.
- **Run a two-wave merge, and a world large enough to actually pressure a hosted runner's
  disk, through `render-world.yml`.** Issue #39's own wave-dispatch checklist item is now
  genuinely proven (a real 361-region world used exactly the two waves planned, watched, not
  assumed). Two things that specific run did not reach: the merge step across those two
  waves (the world was reused for issue #44's staging test instead), and a world anywhere
  near the disk ceiling issue #39 was opened over (that run needed ~6 GiB against ~84 GiB
  free). Record both, with `df -h` evidence, in `docs/large-worlds.md`.
- ~~Test the private-repository Pages 403 mapping, and staging time on a real large map.~~
  **Both done, 2026-08-05 (issue #44, closed for real this time).** The private-repo
  403/422 → "needs a paid plan" mapping was driven both raw (`gh api`) and through the app's
  own `PagesHost` code against a real repository flipped to private, then reverted with the
  original evidence re-verified live. Staging time was measured against a genuinely
  CI-rendered, locally-merged 20,449-hires-tile map (839.4 MB, 20,632 files): `publish()`'s
  real wall time was 423.8 s, itemized (add/commit/push/Pages-build-wait) in the issue —
  295x the files and ~144x the bytes of the original probe at ~12x the wall time. A
  hyphenated-`--map-id` merge bug this run surfaced is tracked and fixed separately as issue
  #47 (closed; see `sanitizeMapId` in Delivery above).

## Deferred verification

lz4-java block-framing constants and PRBM byte-exactness get oracle validation when the
golden harness stands up in Phase D. D17 changes how that harness is built rather than
whether it is needed: the upstream jars are now built from the vendored source with Gradle
rather than pulled as a Docker image, and because the same jar is what renders locally, the
reference implementation is exercised on every render instead of only when someone
remembers to run the harness. Tracked as
[#3](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/material-bluemap/issues/3).

## Release transport follow-up (2026-08-06)

- [x] Replace unsupported `gh release ... --hostname` calls with the supported host-qualified
      `--repo [HOST/]OWNER/REPO` form.
- [x] Resolve the selected account from live `gh` inventory, auto-switch when inactive, verify
      the effective login, and refuse to fall back to another identity.
- [x] Keep identity failures non-mutating and provide GitHub-account recovery on the same screen.
- [x] Document the computer-wide account-switch side effect and leave the selected account active.
- [x] Cover active/inactive, missing, enterprise, refused-switch, mismatch, create-failure, and
      resume paths with focused tests.
- [ ] Re-run the original multi-gigabyte CI-render release flow against an explicitly disposable
      repository and capture the genuine built-app recovery/success surface. This remains external
      verification; the target repository reported by the user was deliberately not mutated.
