/**
 * Rendering in Actions, without losing what a killed job had already done.
 *
 * Four ideas, each in its own file:
 *
 * - `state.ts` - what is cached between runs, under what key, and why the key has the
 *   plan's fingerprint in it. Also the reconciliation of caching `rstate` with the merge's
 *   refusal to merge it.
 * - `marker.ts` - how a shard that finished is told apart from one that was cut off
 *   mid-write, which is the thing a resume gets catastrophically wrong if it guesses.
 * - `waves.ts` - batching more shards than one matrix can hold into sequential waves,
 *   because a world can genuinely need more than 256 and truncating the plan to fit would
 *   publish a map with a corner missing.
 * - `mergeTree.ts` and `lowresMerge.ts` - merging a map too large for one runner to hold,
 *   by finishing hires at the group level and taking only the lowres layers to the end.
