/**
 * Keeping a shard's half-finished work between runs.
 *
 * A shard that hits the six hour job ceiling has spent six hours producing tiles, and
 * those tiles are on the runner's disk when the job is killed. The runner is then thrown
 * away. Everything about resuming a CI render comes down to what leaves that runner
 * before it disappears, and there are exactly two ways out.
 *
 * ## `actions/cache` for the working state, an artifact for the output
 *
 * They are not interchangeable and the split is deliberate.
 *
 * **The cache holds the working state**: the complete BlueMap web root (the shard's map
 * directory *including its `rstate`*, plus the viewer shell), and BlueMap's data directory
 * with the downloaded client jar and the extracted resources. Cache is right for this
 * automatically at the start of a job, which is exactly the shape of "start again where
 * you left off". It is also allowed to disappear: an evicted cache costs a full re-render
 * of that shard and nothing else, and a resume path that *cannot* survive its own storage
 * being evicted is a resume path that turns an eviction into a failure.
 *
 * **The artifact holds the output**: the finished shard map, plus its completion marker.
 * Artifacts are what the merge job consumes and what a person downloads, they are
 * immutable, and they do not compete with the cache's eviction policy. The important
 * difference is that an artifact is written once, at the end, by a shard that finished;
 * the cache is written by every shard whether it finished or not, which is the entire
 * point.
 *
 * ## The key, and the trap in it
 *
 * `actions/cache` will not overwrite an existing key. A key that is identical between two
 * runs therefore saves nothing on the second run: run two restores run one's state,
 * renders for another six hours, and throws all of it away. Three runs of that make no
 * more progress than two.
 *
 * So the key carries the run id and attempt, which makes every save unique, and the
 * *restore* falls back to the longest matching prefix. That prefix is what carries
 * progress forward from run to run.
 *
 * The prefix contains the plan fingerprint, and that is not decoration. Restoring a cache
 * saved under a different plan would drop tiles and `rstate` from a shard that covered a
 * *different rectangle of the world* on top of this one's. `rstate` would then claim work
 * was done that this shard never did, and BlueMap would skip it: a hole in the map, with
 * nothing anywhere reporting a problem. So a different plan cannot match the prefix, and
 * a marker from a different plan is refused separately in `marker.ts`.
 *
 * ## The `rstate` decision this must not undo
 *
 * The shard merge deliberately does not merge `rstate`: shard render-state files group
 * tiles into regions that straddle the shard cuts, so no shard's copy describes the merged
 * map, and a merged copy would make a later incremental render skip tiles it never did.
 * See `merge/mergeMap.ts` and `docs/render-in-actions.md`.
 *
 * Nothing here changes that. `rstate` is cached **per shard, under a key nothing else can
 * restore**, and it is used by exactly one thing: that same shard, rendering the same
 * rectangle, with the same config, in a later run. It never travels in the shard artifact,
 * it never reaches the merge, and it never lands in the published map. The two facts are
 * consistent because they are about different journeys: `rstate` is valid along the one it
 * is kept for, and invalid along the one the merge refuses to take it on.

 * in the run summary without moving a single cut, and refusing to resume over it would be
 * refusing for no reason.
