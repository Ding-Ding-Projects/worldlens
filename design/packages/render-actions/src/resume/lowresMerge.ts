/**
 * The last level of the merge tree: the lowres pyramid, and nothing else.
 *
 * `mergeShardMaps` does the whole map. This does the part of it that still needs doing
 * once the groups have merged, which is only the lowres layers, and it exists because on
 * a large world that difference is the difference between a job that runs and a job that
 * runs out of disk.
 *
 * The arithmetic is the same arithmetic, reused rather than restated:
 * `compositeLowresTile` ranks rendered terrain above an erasure above an untouched pixel
 * and refuses to guess when two sources hold different terrain for one pixel, and
 * `deriveNextLod` reproduces upstream's `LowresLayer#saveTile` averaging including its
 * single-precision truncation. What is different here is what is read: the group partials'
 * `tiles/1` and their metadata, and no hires tiles at all.
 *
 * Lod 2 and above are rebuilt here for the same reason the shard merge rebuilds them: a
 * partial's coarse lods were averaged over pixels that partial had not rendered, they
 * carry the same alpha as correct ones, and no amount of compositing can tell the two
 * apart. The only complete source is the merged lod 1.
