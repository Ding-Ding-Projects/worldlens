/**
 * Turning a rendered map into something a **dumb static host** can serve.
 *
 * This exists because of one detail that is invisible until the map is already published
 * and every tile comes back 404.
 *
 * The engine stores hires tiles gzip-compressed, so the file on disk is `0.prbm.gz` and
 * the map's texture data is `textures.json.gz`. The viewer, however, asks for `0.prbm`
 * and `textures.json` — *unless* the web app's own `settings.json` says
 * `clientDecompression: true`, in which case it appends `.gz` to both and inflates the
 * bytes itself with `DecompressionStream("gzip")`.
 *
 * Upstream's default is `false`, and that default is correct for upstream, because
 * BlueMap's own web server answers a request for `0.prbm` out of `0.prbm.gz`. So does
 * this app's embedded server, which is why a map looks perfect in the app and then fails
 * completely the moment it is copied somewhere else.
 *
 * GitHub Pages will not do that for us. It serves the files that exist, under their real
 * names, and 404s the rest. There is no configuration, no rewrite rule, and no
 * `.htaccess` — that is the whole point of it.
 *
 * So a map that is going to be hosted statically has to have the flag flipped, and the
 * flip has to be **verified against the files that are actually on disk** rather than
 * assumed: flipping it changes which URLs the viewer requests, and a flag that points the
 * viewer at files nobody wrote is exactly as broken as the problem it fixes.
 *
 * Nothing here uploads anything or knows what GitHub is. It prepares a directory and
 * reports what it found, so the app and the CI workflow can share one answer to
 * "is this map servable as plain files?" instead of each having an opinion.
