/**
 * Writes the BlueMap CLI configuration directory one shard renders with.
 *
 * Two things here are load-bearing and are easy to get wrong:
 *
 * 1. Every path is absolute. The CLI resolves its data directory and its storage root
 *    against the process working directory, not against the configuration folder, so a
 *    relative path silently puts the output somewhere other than where the workflow
 *    then looks for it.
 *
 * 2. `render-edges` is false. With it on, BlueMap treats every block outside the
 *    render-mask as air, which is the right behaviour for someone deliberately cutting
 *    a slice out of a world and the wrong behaviour for a shard: the blocks on the far
 *    side of the cut are real, another shard is rendering them, and pretending they are
 *    air changes the lighting of the tiles along this shard's edge. With it off the mask
 *    only decides which columns get rendered, and a shard's tiles come out byte for byte
 *    identical to the same tiles from an unsharded render.
