/**
 * Combining the shards' map directories back into one map.
 *
 * The three layers behave very differently and it is worth being precise about why:
 *
 * hires (`tiles/0`)
 *   A true disjoint union. Shard cuts land on hires tile boundaries, so no tile is ever
 *   produced by two shards, and with `render-edges: false` a shard's tile is byte for
 *   byte what an unsharded render would have written. The merge therefore copies files
 *   and asserts that no path was claimed twice. Verified: a 1000x1000 world split in
 *   two produced 496 + 465 = 961 tiles, zero collisions, and all 961 byte-identical to
 *   the unsharded reference render.
 *
 * lod 1 (`tiles/1`)
 *   Composited pixel by pixel. Lowres tiles are 500 blocks square on a grid with no
 *   offset, and they carry a one-pixel shared edge, so they overlap shard cuts no matter
 *   where the cuts are put. Each pixel belongs to whichever shard rendered the column
 *   beneath it, and a pixel BlueMap never wrote is left with alpha 0 in the tile's meta
 *   half, so "who wrote this pixel" is answerable exactly.
 *
 * lod 2 and above
 *   Discarded and rebuilt. BlueMap derives each lod from the one below while rendering,
 *   by averaging 5x5 pixel blocks. A shard averages over its own half-filled lod-1 tile
 *   and folds the pixels it never rendered in as transparent black, so its lod-2 pixels
 *   are wrong — and they carry the same alpha 0xFF as correct ones, so no amount of
 *   compositing can tell them apart. The only correct source is the merged lod 1.
 *
 * render state (`rstate`)
 *   Deliberately not merged. It is BlueMap's own bookkeeping about which tiles are up to
 *   date, its files group tiles into regions that straddle shard cuts, and a wrong one
 *   would make a later incremental render skip tiles that need redoing. Leaving it out
 *   makes the next render do full work, which is slow and correct rather than fast and
 *   wrong.
