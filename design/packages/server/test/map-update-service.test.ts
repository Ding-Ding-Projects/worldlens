 * Writes a region file and keeps re-touching it until something reacts.

 * there -- see usesPollingForCurrentRuntime's own comment for the observed abort, which is why
 * polling is not negotiable. Chokidar's polling sees a new directory entry in about 115ms when
 * it works, and intermittently one watcher in a run never arms at all: instrumented, its run
 * loop was healthy, updateRegion never ran, and take() simply never returned. Every test in
 * this file passes alone; the failing set moves between runs.
 *
 * Re-touching with different bytes recovers the ordinary case where one poll was missed --
 * nothing these tests assert depends on how many writes produced the event, and a region file
 * being rewritten repeatedly is what happens while a server runs. A poller compares size and
 * mtime, so the content differs each time: rewriting identical bytes inside one filesystem
 * timestamp tick is indistinguishable from no write at all.
 *
 * It does not recover a watcher that never armed, and it is not pretending to. What it
 * replaces is a bare ten-second timeout that said only "expected +0 to be 1" with a message
 * naming the file and how many writes went unanswered, which is the difference between a
 * mystery and a report.
