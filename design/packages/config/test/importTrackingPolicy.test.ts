/**
 * "Could not resolve './home.js' from 'src/copy/surfaces/index.ts'" - a `pnpm build` failure
 * that has bitten this repository repeatedly (the console files committed at `f4d3abd` and
 * only tracked at `897ecad`; `tutorialSignals.js`; `glossary.js`; three more CI cycles spent
 * chasing it across `4786eb0`, `31a5720` and `04cb4a2`), always the same shape: a commit
 * imports a sibling module, and the sibling module itself stays untracked.
 *
 * The reason it keeps happening is structural, not carelessness. `vitest` and the dev server
 * resolve an import straight off the working disk - they have no concept of git and no reason
 * to - so every local check an agent actually runs before pushing is blind to the defect by
 * construction. The one check that would catch it, `pnpm build`, is slow enough that nobody
 * runs it before pushing. So the defect is invisible exactly where people look (the fast
 * suite) and visible only where they do not (a CI run several minutes later).
 *
 * This file closes that gap by putting the same question `pnpm build` eventually asks -
 * "does every import resolve to something that will actually exist in a fresh checkout?" -
 * into the suite everyone already runs. It does two things a mere `existsSync` check cannot:
 *
 *  1. **It asks git, not the filesystem.** A file existing on disk is exactly the condition
 *     that makes this bug invisible, so "resolves" here means "resolves to a path git
 *     tracks", read once from `git ls-files` rather than assumed from whatever the working
 *     tree happens to hold this second.
 *  2. **It resolves the way the bundler does, not the way `fs.existsSync` does.** This
 *     codebase writes `./home.js` in source for a file that is really `home.ts` on disk -
 *     deliberate ESM-style extension rewriting - and it writes bare directory specifiers
 *     that resolve through an `index.ts`. A specifier is checked against every path the
 *     bundler could plausibly mean, not just its literal text.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do: parse TypeScript. Every import/export-from/dynamic-import
 * statement is found with a focused regex over (comment-stripped) source text, matching this
 * repository's own house style for this kind of structural check (see
 * `packages/ui/src/components/overlayDismissalPolicy.test.ts` and
 * `packages/ui/src/components/config/regexPolicy.test.ts`). Comments are stripped first
 * because this codebase's own doc comments routinely show worked "```ts / import { x } from
 * './y.js'" examples, and a naive regex would flag every one of them as a real import - the
 * exact false-positive risk this file exists to avoid, not just to tolerate.
 *
 * Cross-cutting rather than package-scoped, so it lives beside this workspace's other
 * structural checks that read outside their own package's `src/` (`controlPolicy.test.ts`
 * reads vendored Java sources; `vendorGate.ts` gates on a checkout elsewhere in the repo)
 * rather than inside any one consuming package, none of which owns "does the whole workspace
 * commit its own imports".

 * spelled correctly, and it resolves to a tracked target - every question the guard above knows
 * how to ask comes back clean. What was missing was the EXPORT *inside* `useAppearance.ts`: an

 * was already tracked - not a new file, not a rename - so nothing about "is this path in git"
 * had anything to say about it (the fix for this exact pair of files landed at `2f3f22e`, and
 * this guard exists so the next such pair gets caught here instead of on `pnpm build`).
 *
 * Both bugs are the same species - a commit ships an import without shipping what it imports -
 * wearing a different symptom depending on whether the missing half is a FILE or a BINDING
 * inside an already-tracked file. `git ls-files` only answers the first question. Answering the
 * second means reading the actual committed CONTENT of both sides, which is why every read
 * below goes through `git show`/`git cat-file` rather than `readFileSync`: the working disk is
