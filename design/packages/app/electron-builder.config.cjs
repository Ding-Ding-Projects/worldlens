/**
 * electron-builder packaging configuration for the Worldlens desktop app.
 *
 * Why electron-builder and not Electron Forge: Forge's packager step drives its
 * pruning through the package manager and needs pnpm's hoisted node-linker to
 * resolve a workspace app. This monorepo uses pnpm's default isolated linker, and
 * changing that would affect every package, not just this one. electron-builder
 * packages a pre-built directory instead, which is all this app needs.
 *
 * Why Squirrel.Windows and not NSIS: the shared project rules prefer
 * Squirrel.Windows for Electron apps on Windows, because it also emits the
 * RELEASES / .nupkg pair that Electron's own autoUpdater consumes.
 *
 * What actually gets packaged: build.mjs bundles the main process (ESM) and the
 * preload (CJS) with esbuild, inlining every runtime dependency except `electron`
 * itself. So the shipped app is the `dist` tree plus this package.json — no
 * node_modules tree is copied into the asar, which is what the negated node_modules
 * pattern below asserts.
