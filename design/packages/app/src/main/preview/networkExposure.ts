/**
 * Whether "host this render live" defaults to loopback-only or to every interface on this
 * network, remembered per installation - the same persisted-choice shape
 * `files/downloadConcurrency.ts` uses for its own single setting, applied to a boolean
 * instead of a bounded number.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as a setting at all, rather than only a per-session checkbox
 *
 * The security rule this whole feature answers to is unambiguous: bind to loopback by
 * default, and network exposure is an explicit, informed opt-in every time. A checkbox that
 * always starts unticked already satisfies "never default it on" for a single session. What
 * it cannot do honestly is remember somebody's real, repeated choice - somebody who reads
 * the warning once, decides they trust their own home network, and ticks it every single
 * time they host a render is not being asked to make an informed choice on the second
 * occasion, they are being nagged. This store is what lets the panel's own default track
 * that decision instead, while the opt-in language and the warning **stay on screen every
 * time regardless of what this remembers** - see `previewHost.ts` and `PreviewHostPanel.vue`.
 *
 * The value this store holds is a *default*, never an override: whatever it says, the panel
 * still shows the exposure checkbox unticked-by-default on first open and still shows the
 * full consequence sentence beside it. Nothing here can silently expose a render to the
 * network with no control on screen saying so.
 *
 * ## The default stays off
 *
 * `false` (loopback only) is both the shipped default and what a missing or corrupt file
 * degrades to - a settings file that cannot be read must never be interpreted as "somebody
 * asked for network exposure."
