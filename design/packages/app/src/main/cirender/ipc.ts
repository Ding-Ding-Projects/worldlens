/**
 * The CI-render channel between the main process and the interface.
 *
 * The fourth of its kind, built to the shape `backup/ipc.ts`, `download/ipc.ts` and
 * `config/ipc.ts` established: `IpcMain` arrives as a **parameter** and Electron only as a
 * *type*, every channel is named once in {@link CIRENDER_CHANNELS} so `dispose` cannot
 * drift from `install`, and every progress event is **pushed** rather than polled. Nothing
 * else under `cirender/` imports Electron, which is what lets the whole loop - the
 * fingerprint, the plan, the dispatch, the polling, the collector - be tested with no
 * Electron runtime anywhere near it.
 *
 * ## The token never crosses, and neither does the EULA decision
 *
 * The credential is resolved here, per call, from the session the main process holds,
 * exactly as the backup and download channels resolve theirs. The renderer learns whether
 * somebody is signed in only from a refusal that says so.
 *
 * `eulaAccepted` is a **reader** the application supplies, and there is deliberately no
 * channel that sets it. Mojang's licence is accepted in the one place that already asks,
 * and a second door onto that decision - especially one a render screen could push
 * somebody through - is how a legal acceptance becomes a button people click to get on
 * with what they were doing.
 *
 * ## Two checks that look alike and are not
 *
 * `cirender:preflight` reads the repository so the interface can warn about a public one,
 * and say what would be uploaded, *before* anything is packed. `cirender:start` reads it
 * again and refuses to proceed without the acknowledgements. The second is not redundant:
 * the first is a courtesy, the second is the guard, and a guard that lives only in the
 * renderer is not a guard.
