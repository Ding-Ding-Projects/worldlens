/**
 * The GitHub Actions calls a CI render makes, and nothing else.
 *
 * Six things happen here: the repository's default branch is read (a dispatch is refused
 * without a ref), the **Render world** workflow is dispatched, the run it produced is
 * found, the run and its jobs are read, one failing job's log tail is fetched, and the
 * run's artifacts are listed. Nothing here uploads, downloads a world, or holds a token
 * of its own - the token arrives as an argument on every call, resolved per operation by
 * the caller from `github/session.ts`, exactly as `backup/github.ts` takes it.
 *
 * ## Why the run has to be *found* rather than returned
 *
 * `POST .../dispatches` answers **204 with an empty body**. GitHub does not tell the
 * caller which run it just created, and there is no correlation id to send. The only
 * route back to the run is to list the workflow's runs and take the newest one created
 * at or after the moment of the dispatch, which is what {@link findDispatchedRun} does.
 *
 * That is a real ambiguity and it is handled by refusing to create it: `sync.ts` will not
 * start a second CI render for the same repository and map while one is recorded as in
 * flight. Two dispatches inside the same window would otherwise be indistinguishable, and
 * following the wrong one means reporting somebody else's failure as theirs - or worse,
 * downloading somebody else's map and registering it as this world's.
 *
 * ## Every status is read, never inferred
 *
 * A run's `status` and `conclusion` are reported exactly as GitHub gives them, and a
 * `conclusion` of `null` is passed through as null rather than being softened into
 * "probably fine". A run that is still going has no conclusion; inventing one is the
 * single thing this module must never do.
