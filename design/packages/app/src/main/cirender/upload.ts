/**
 * Publishing a world so GitHub's runners can render it: one packer, either credential.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all, and what it deliberately is not
 *
 * A CI render cannot start until the world is on GitHub, and for a while that step was the
 * one thing a machine with only `gh` could not do. The reasoning was that routing an upload
 * through `gh release upload` would be a *second uploader* - a second archive format, a
 * second part-naming scheme, a second set of release rules, and two ways for a backup made
 * today to be unreadable tomorrow.
 *
 * That reasoning was right about the packer and wrong about the transfer, so the line is
 * now drawn between them. Everything that decides what the bytes *are* is imported from
 * `main/backup/` and is not restated here: {@link packFolder} makes the archive,
 * {@link splitFile} cuts it, {@link partAssetName} names each part after its own digest,
 * {@link serializeCheapLfsPointer} writes the pointer and {@link serializeSidecar} writes
 * `backup.json`. A world published by this module is byte-for-byte a world published by the
 * backup runner, and either can be restored by the existing downloader.
 *
 * What is route-aware is only the **transfer** - create the release, list what it already
 * holds, put one file on it - and that lives behind {@link CiTransport}, so the REST calls
 * and the `gh` commands are two implementations of one interface rather than two uploaders.
 *
 * ## The order is the safety property, and the pointer goes last
 *
 * Parts, then the sidecar, then the pointer. The pointer is the **completion marker**: a
 * release carrying one is an upload that finished, and a release with parts and no pointer
 * is one that stopped part-way. Writing it first - so the release looks complete while the
 * parts are still going up - would produce a world somebody trusts that restores as an
 * unverifiable fragment on the day they need it.
 *
 * ## Resuming, and why it is worth the code
 *
 * A world is measured in gigabytes and a domestic connection is measured in hours, so an
 * interrupted upload that started over would frequently never finish at all. Two things
 * make carrying on cheap, and both work identically on both routes because both are asked
 * of the transport rather than of a credential:
 *
 * - the **staged archive** is re-used when one is already there, and it is *hashed* rather
 *   than trusted, because a half-written archive from a killed process has exactly the name
 *   and roughly the size a finished one would have;
 * - the **assets already on the release** are read back and skipped when the name *and* the
 *   size match. The name is what makes that a digest check rather than a guess: a part's
 *   asset name carries the first sixteen hex characters of its own SHA-256, so an asset
 *   under that name is one whose content hashed to that value when it went up. A part whose
 *   size does not match is a truncated upload and is sent again - which is what
 *   `gh release upload --clobber` exists for on the `gh` side.
 *
 * ## Every staged file is named as its asset before anything is uploaded
 *
 * `gh release upload` names an asset after the file's own basename, so a part staged as
 * `world.zip.000` would land under a name the pointer never mentions and a restore would
 * look for an asset that is not there. The rename happens here, once, for both routes,
 * rather than being a quirk one transport works around invisibly.
