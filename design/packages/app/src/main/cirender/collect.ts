/**
 * Fetching the map a finished run produced, and registering it as a local render.
 *
 * This is the last third of the loop and the only part that writes a map onto this
 * computer, so everything it refuses, it refuses *before* anything is mounted. A CI render
 * that half-worked must never leave something in the map list that opens to an empty
 * world; the failure it would be mistaken for - "the render came out blank" - is one
 * nobody could diagnose without knowing this code exists.
 *
 * ## Reusing the download surface rather than writing a second one
 *
 * The transfer is `download/http.ts`'s {@link downloadToFile}, which resumes an
 * interrupted attempt from a `Range` request, and the unpack is `download/extract.ts`'s
 * {@link extractZip}, which already carries the path-traversal defences. An Actions
 * artifact is not a release asset, so `ReleaseDownloader` itself cannot be pointed at one
 * - but its two primitives can, and that is the difference between reusing the download
 * surface and building a second one beside it.
 *
 * ## Verified, or recorded, and the difference is stated
 *
 * GitHub publishes a `digest` on an artifact when the instance is new enough to have one.
 * When it is there the downloaded bytes are checked against it and a mismatch is a
 * refusal. An ordinary green run without one is recorded as `verified: false`, exactly as
 * `download/downloader.ts` distinguishes the two for a whole asset with no published
 * checksum. Recovery from a red run sets `requirePublishedDigest` and refuses before the
 * download when GitHub supplied none. Calling a recorded digest a verification would be a
 * claim this code cannot support.
 *
 * ## A map that shipped in parts is refused, not guessed at
 *
 * A world too large for one runner to assemble publishes `map-lowres` plus one
 * `partial-hires-N` per merge group, and the run summary explains how to put them
 * together. Unpacking `map-lowres` on its own would produce a map that loads, shows the
 * overview, and has no detail at any zoom - which looks like a rendering bug rather than
 * a missing download. So it is refused with the reason and the artifacts named.
