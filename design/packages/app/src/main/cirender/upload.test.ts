/**
 * The uploader, against a recording fake of the transfer.

 * The point of these is that they are **route-agnostic**. Every property asserted here -
 * the order the assets go up in, what the pointer says, which assets a resumed upload skips
 * and which it sends again - is a property of the one packer, not of a credential. A fake
 * transport is what makes that provable: if any of this behaviour lived in the `gh` side or
 * in the REST side instead, these tests would have to be written twice and the two copies
