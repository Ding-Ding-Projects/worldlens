/**
 * What a CI render remembers between attempts, and where it keeps it.
 *
 * A CI render is a loop with four network-shaped steps in it - upload, dispatch, wait,
 * collect - and any of them can be interrupted by the thing most likely to interrupt
 * them, which is the application being closed while a run is still going. Without a
 * record on disk, reopening the app after lunch means the run on GitHub is finished, the
 * map is sitting in an artifact, and this computer has no idea any of it happened.
 *
 * So every step that produces a durable fact writes it down: which fingerprint was
 * uploaded, under which tag and asset name, which run that dispatch produced, and how it
 * ended. Starting a sync reads the record first, which is what makes `start` and `resume`
 * the same operation - see `sync.ts`.
 *
 * ## Where the render itself lands, and why not here
 *
 * The record and the downloaded artifact live under `<storage>/ci-render/<syncId>/`. The
 * **map** does not: it is unpacked into `<storage>/<renderId>/web`, beside every locally
 * rendered map, with the same `render.json` next to it. That is the whole point of the
 * feature - a map rendered on GitHub's runners has to open exactly like one rendered on
 * this computer - and putting it in a special folder that only this subsystem knows about
 * is how it would end up not appearing in the map list at all.
 *
 * The render id is prefixed `ci-` rather than reusing `renderIdForWorld`'s answer
 * directly. Two renders of the same world writing to one directory would have the CI
 * collector delete a local render's tiles to unpack over them, which is a data loss with
 * no warning and no undo.
