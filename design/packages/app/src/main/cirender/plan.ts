/**
 * Turning a world's own project file into the nine strings the workflow takes.
 *
 * A CI render must be **repeatable**, and repeatable means it does not depend on what
 * somebody typed into a form at four in the afternoon. The world carries
 * `worldlens.project.json` at its root - see `@worldlens/config`'s
 * `project.ts` - and that file already holds the maps, their ids, their display names and
 * their dimensions. So the plan is read out of it, and syncing the same world twice
 * produces the same inputs without anybody remembering anything.
 *
 * ## How the complete map configuration reaches the workflow
 *
 * `render-world.yml` takes nine `workflow_dispatch` inputs, and GitHub caps a workflow at
 * ten. The map's ninety-odd settings do not travel through that narrow API at all. They
 * already live in `worldlens.project.json`, inside the exact world archive this
 * sync uploads. The runner reads the selected map's complete HOCON from that project and
 * writes it before its runtime-owned path and shard overrides. This contract records that
 * route explicitly so the app, workflow and UI cannot drift back to a guessed subset.
 *
 * ## The dimension is checked here, not by GitHub
 *
 * `dimension` is a `type: choice` input with exactly three options. A project map naming
 * anything else - a modded dimension, a custom datapack world - is refused here with a
 * sentence saying which three are possible. Sent anyway, GitHub answers 422 with a
 * generic message that reads as "the workflow is broken", which sends people to the wrong
 * place entirely.
