/**
 * Driving a CI render through the `gh` command-line tool instead of the in-app sign-in.
 *
 * ## Why a second route at all
 *
 * Plenty of people already have `gh` installed and signed in, and it holds credentials the
 * application's own sign-in does not: an enterprise host, a SAML/SSO session already
 * authorised for an organisation, a token with scopes the in-app flow never asked for.
 * Somebody in that position should be able to render a world without signing in to a
 * second thing, and somebody whose in-app token turns out to be short a scope should get a
 * route that works rather than a dead end.
 *
 * This module is only the transport. It has no idea what a render is: it detects `gh`,
 * reports honestly what it found, and turns `gh api` calls into JSON and files.
 *
 * ## Three states, three sentences
 *
 * "gh is not installed", "gh is installed but nobody is signed in" and "gh is ready" are
 * different situations with different remedies, and collapsing them into "gh unavailable"
 * sends half the people to the wrong fix. {@link detectGh} answers all three separately,
 * with the account name when there is one.
 *
 * ## `gh auth login` is never driven from here, and that is a hard-won rule
 *
 * `gh auth login` and `gh auth refresh` **suppress the device-code prompt when stdin is
 * not a terminal**. Spawned from an application they therefore print nothing and hang for
 * ever, and no amount of waiting fixes it. Launching a console to give it a terminal does
 * not rescue it either. So when the fallback needs a sign-in this module says so and names
 * the command for the person to run in their own terminal; the result is then detected on
 * the next probe. Nothing here attempts to drive it.
 *
 * ## Nothing here ever handles, prints or logs a token
 *
 * `gh` holds its own credential in its own store and this module never asks for it:
 * `--show-token` is never passed, no `GH_TOKEN` is set or read, and the only thing taken
 * from `gh auth status` is whether it succeeded and which account it named. Every command
 * is spawned with an argument array and never through a shell, so nothing in a repository
 * name can become part of a command line.
