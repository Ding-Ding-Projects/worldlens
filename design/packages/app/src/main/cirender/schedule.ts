/**
 * Configuring scheduled re-rendering from the app: turning it on, choosing a cadence, and
 * reading back what `.github/workflows/scheduled-render.yml` found. See
 * docs/scheduled-render.md for the workflow side; this file only reads and writes the
 * repository variables that connect the two, through the transport a sync already chose -
 * see `transport.ts`'s `readVariable`/`writeVariable`.
 *
 * ## Guided, never a cron expression
 *
 * The cadence is one of four guided presets or a validated custom whole-hour interval,
 * re-exported from `@worldlens/render-actions` so the app and the workflow can never
 * disagree about what a stored value means. Nothing here accepts cron or arbitrary text.
 *
 * ## What "configuring" actually writes
 *
 * Scheduling a world only makes sense once it has been uploaded at least once - the
 * workflow needs a release asset to watch. So {@link writeCiSchedule} takes the sync's own
 * {@link CiSyncState} and derives `world-source=release-asset` and
 * `world=<releaseTag>/<assetName>` from it, rather than asking a person to type a release
 * tag they would have to go and look up. Turning scheduling on for a world that has never
 * been uploaded is refused, with the reason, before anything is written.
