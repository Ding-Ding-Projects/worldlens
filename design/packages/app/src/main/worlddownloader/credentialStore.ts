/**
 * Where the downloader's token lives between launches.
 *
 * This is the safe-storage envelope the retired in-app GitHub token store used, kept here
 * because the world downloader still needs exactly this: one ciphertext under the app's
 * data directory, written through the OS credential store or not at all. GitHub
 * credentials themselves are brokered by the gh CLI now (see `../ghcli/`), and nothing in
 * this module talks to GitHub - `secret.ts` stores a Minecraft access token in it.
 *
 * The only acceptable answer on a desktop machine is the operating system's own
 * credential store: DPAPI on Windows, the Keychain on macOS, libsecret on Linux.
 * Electron's `safeStorage` is the one interface to all three, so that is what this uses,
 * and the ciphertext is what lands on disk.
 *
 * The rule that matters most here is the refusal. `safeStorage.isEncryptionAvailable()`
 * returns false on a Linux desktop with no secret service running, and it would be very
 * easy - and completely wrong - to fall back to writing the token in a plain file so
 * that "sign-in works everywhere". A plaintext token in a predictable path under the
 * user profile is readable by every process running as that user, backed up by whatever
 * syncs that folder, and indistinguishable to the person from a token that is properly
 * protected. So this refuses, says why, and lets the session carry on in memory for as
 * long as the app is open.
 *
 * The write itself is staged and renamed, the same shape `consent.ts` uses, so a crash
 * halfway through cannot leave a truncated file that decrypts to nothing.
