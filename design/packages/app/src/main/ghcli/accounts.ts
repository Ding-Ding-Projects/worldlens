/**
 * The `gh` command-line tool's OWN accounts - not this application's.
 *
 * ## Two stores, never merged
 *
 * `main/github/accounts.ts` (`GitHubAccountsController`) is this application's own
 * multi-account credential store: a token per account, in this app's own encrypted files,
 * under this app's own control. This module reads a *completely different* store - `gh`'s
 * own `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` (or wherever `gh` itself decides to keep it), shared by
 * every terminal, script and other tool on this machine that happens to shell out to
 * `gh`. The two can disagree at any moment: an account signed in to `gh` may never have
 * touched this app, an account signed in to this app may never have touched `gh`, and
 * "the active account" can be a different login in each store at the same time. Nothing
 * here reconciles them, and nothing in the interface may present them as one list - see
 * `packages/ui/src/components/github/GhCliAccountsList.vue`, which renders this module's
 * accounts in a visibly separate section from `GitHubAccountsList.vue`'s own.
 *
 * ## Read the real machine-readable route, do not scrape prose by default
 *
 * `gh auth status --json hosts` (confirmed present on the `gh` version this was built
 * against, 2.96.0) answers structured JSON on stdout and, unlike the plain-text form,
 * **exits 0 even when nobody is signed in to anything** - only a fatal error makes it
 * fail. That is the route {@link listGhCliAccounts} prefers. Only when that JSON cannot be
 * parsed at all - an old `gh` that does not recognise `--json` - does it fall back to
 * {@link parseGhAuthStatusText}, which is deliberately isolated in its own function with
 * its own tests over real captured output, and returns `null` (never an empty list) when
 * the text itself is not in a shape this module recognises. An unrecognised format is
 * reported as exactly that - `availability: "unrecognised"` - never silently reported as
 * zero accounts, which would read as "you are not signed in to anything" when the truth
 * is "this application could not understand what gh said".
 *
 * ## Sign-in is driven by the GUI without driving gh's interactive prompt
 *
 * `gh auth login` and `gh auth refresh` suppress their device-code prompt when stdin is not
 * a terminal, so `login.ts` never tries to scrape that prompt. It performs GitHub's public
 * device exchange itself, shows the code through secret-free IPC, and writes the approved
 * token once to `gh auth login --with-token` over stdin. `gh` still owns the credential;
 * this application keeps no copy.
 *
 * ## Switching is machine-wide, and the switch here proves rather than assumes
 *
 * `gh auth switch` changes which account every other terminal, script and tool on this
 * computer gets when it shells out to `gh` - it is not scoped to this application in any
 * way. {@link switchGhCliAccount} never reports success from `gh`'s exit code alone: it
 * re-reads the account list afterwards and only reports `ok: true` when the requested
 * login is genuinely the active one on that host now. The machine-wide sentence itself
 * lives in the returned `message` so the caller cannot forget to say it.
 *
 * ## Never the token
 *
 * `--show-token` is never passed, `GH_TOKEN` is never read or set, and nothing here ever
 * asks `gh` for a credential - only for the account list and the auth-switch outcome, both
 * of which name accounts and never carry a secret.
