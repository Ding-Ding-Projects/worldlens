/**
 * GitHub's OAuth device flow, which is how this application signs somebody in.
 *
 * The flow is: ask GitHub for a pair of codes, show the person the short one, send them
 * to a page where they type it, and poll until they have. It was chosen over the usual
 * redirect-based authorization code flow for three reasons, and each of them is a real
 * constraint rather than a preference:
 *
 * 1. A desktop application cannot keep a client secret. The bundle is on the user's
 *    disk. The authorization code flow's confidential variant needs one; the device flow
 *    needs none, so there is no secret to fail to protect.
 * 2. There is no redirect to catch. The alternatives are a loopback HTTP server on a
 *    port the app has to guess, or a custom URL scheme registered with the operating
 *    system. Both are more moving parts, and both are more attack surface, for a sign-in
 *    that happens once.
 * 3. The machine rendering a world need not be the machine with a browser on it. The
 *    user code is eight characters and a hyphen; it can be typed on a phone.
 *
 * Nothing here touches Electron, the filesystem, or the clock directly, so all of it is
 * testable: `fetch`, `sleep` and `now` are parameters.
