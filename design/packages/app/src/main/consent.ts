/**
 * Mojang download consent.
 *
 * BlueMap textures a map from the real Minecraft client jar, so it cannot render
 * anything until the person running it accepts Mojang's EULA. Upstream expresses
 * that as `accept-download` in `core.conf`, defaulting to false.
 *
 * This module makes the decision **once**. After it is accepted the answer is
 * persisted and never asked again: not on the next render, not on the next launch,
 * not after an update. Re-asking a question somebody has already answered is
 * nagging, and it trains people to click through consent screens without reading
 * them, which defeats the point of having one.
 *
 * What this does NOT do is weaken the gate in the engine. `MinecraftVersion.load`
 * still takes `allowDownload` as a required parameter with no default, so no code
 * path can download a Mojang jar without being handed an explicit answer. This
 * module is only where that answer is remembered.
