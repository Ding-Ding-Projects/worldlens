/**
 * Getting a JDK onto a machine that does not have one, without asking anybody to.
 *
 * Decision D17 made a JVM a requirement for local rendering, and the honest cost of
 * that is stated in the decision itself. What is not acceptable is passing the cost
 * on as a chore: "install a JDK, set JAVA_HOME, restart the app" is a wall that ends
 * the session for most people. So the app fetches one for itself.
 *
 * The rules it fetches under:
 *
 * - **Nothing machine-wide.** The JDK goes under Electron's `userData`, no registry
 *   key is written, no `PATH` is edited, no installer runs and no elevation is asked
 *   for. Uninstalling the app takes the JDK with it.
 * - **Verified before use.** The SHA-256 comes from the Adoptium API response that
 *   carried the download link, and it is checked against the finished file before a
 *   single byte is extracted. There is no path through this module that installs an
 *   artefact whose digest was missing, unparseable or wrong.
 * - **Resumable, and never half-installed.** The download resumes from a `.part`
 *   file; the extraction lands in a staging directory and is renamed into place only
 *   after a real `bin/java` has been found in it.
 * - **Only when asked.** Nothing here runs as a side effect of looking for Java.
 *   Downloading 200 MB is a decision, and it belongs to the person using the app.
