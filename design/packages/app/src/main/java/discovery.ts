/**
 * Finding a usable JVM on whatever machine the app happens to be running on.
 *
 * The order is the runtime bundled inside the installer, then `JAVA_HOME`, then `java`
 * on `PATH`, then a copy the app downloaded for itself.
 *
 * It used to start at `JAVA_HOME`, on the reasoning that somebody who set it had told
 * their whole machine which JDK to use, and that the app's own copy should be the last
 * resort because it was the one nobody chose. That was the right call while the app had
 * no runtime of its own: the only alternative was something downloaded after the fact.
 *
 * It stopped being the right call when the installer began carrying a JRE. A bundled
 * dependency has to resolve bundled-first, or the JVM a person is running is decided by
 * whatever else happens to be installed beside the app, and a report of "renders fail on
 * my machine" cannot be reproduced from the release alone. The bundled copy is also the
 * one that was actually tested against this build.
 *
 * What the change does cost is worth stating rather than glossing. The search stops at
 * the first candidate that passes, so once a bundled runtime is present, `JAVA_HOME` and
 * `PATH` are no longer probed at all and do not appear in `rejected`. A person who set
 * `JAVA_HOME` deliberately is therefore not told it was passed over. The mitigation is
 * that the chosen installation reports `source: "bundled"`, so any surface showing the
 * runtime can say plainly which java is in use; "it silently used a different JDK than I
 * configured" must not be a thing a user can experience without being able to see it.
 *
 * Every candidate is *run* before it is accepted. A path is not evidence: `JAVA_HOME`
 * outlives the JDK it pointed at, a `java` on `PATH` may be a shim for a version
 * manager that resolves differently per directory, and a folder named `jdk-25` can
 * contain a JDK 17. Nothing here concludes anything from a name.
 *
 * Rejections are collected rather than discarded. When no JVM is suitable the caller
 * needs to say *why* — "JAVA_HOME points at Java 17" is actionable, "no Java found"
 * on a machine with three JDKs installed is baffling.
