/**
 * Unpacking a JDK archive without ever leaving something that looks finished but is not.
 *
 * Extraction is the step where a cancelled download does its real damage. If bytes go
 * straight into the final directory, an interrupted run leaves a tree that has a
 * `bin/java` in it and is missing half of `lib`, which then fails at launch with a
 * linker error that has nothing to do with the actual cause. So extraction happens
 * into a sibling staging directory, the result is checked for a real `bin/java`, and
 * only then is it moved into place with a rename. A rename on one filesystem is
 * atomic, so the destination either does not exist or is complete.
 *
 * Stale staging directories from earlier interrupted runs are swept before each
 * attempt, because "resumable" must not mean "accumulates a 400 MB directory per
 * failed try".
 *
 * `tar` does the unpacking on every platform. Windows 10 1803 and later ship bsdtar
 * as `System32\tar.exe`, and bsdtar reads zip as well as tar.gz, so one code path
 * covers Temurin's `.zip` on Windows and `.tar.gz` everywhere else with no archive
 * library in the dependency tree. The Windows path is resolved through `SystemRoot`
 * rather than through `PATH`: a machine with Git or MSYS installed has a GNU `tar`
 * on `PATH` in some shells, and GNU tar cannot read zip at all.
