/**
 * Where the BlueMap jars are, in a packaged app and in a checkout.
 *
 * Decisions D17 and D18 give the app seven jars to care about: the CLI it drives to
 * render, and the six Minecraft-server platform adapters it hands to users who run a
 * server. In a packaged build they are bundled resources next to the app. In a
 * checkout they are whatever `tools/build-jars.mjs` last staged, or failing that
 * whatever Gradle left in `vendor/BlueMap/implementations/<name>/build/libs`.
 *
 * One resolver answers for both, because the alternative is every caller carrying an
 * `app.isPackaged` branch and the two paths drifting until only one of them is ever
 * tested.
 *
 * The version is read off the filename rather than out of the jar. Upstream's build
 * derives it from `git describe` (`buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/versioning.kt`) and the
 * shadow task writes it straight into the archive name as
 * `<implementation>-<version>-shadow.jar`, so `cli-5.22-27-shadow.jar` is version
 * `5.22-27`. Reading the manifest would mean unzipping a 6 MB jar on every launch to
 * learn something the filename already says exactly.
