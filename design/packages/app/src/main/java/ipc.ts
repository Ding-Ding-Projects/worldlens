/**
 * The Java-runtime channel between the main process and the settings screen.
 *
 * Built to the same shape as `world/index.ts`: Electron arrives as a *type*, `IpcMain`
 * is a parameter, and the import is erased at build time - so this module, and with it
 * the rest of this directory, still runs and is still tested without an Electron
 * runtime. Every channel is named once in {@link JAVA_CHANNELS} so `dispose` cannot
 * drift from the registration.
 *
 * `invoke`/`handle` rather than pushed, unlike rendering and downloading. Discovery is
 * a question with one answer that arrives in about as long as it takes to launch three
 * processes, so there is no progress to report and nothing to cancel.
 *
 * ## What is allowed to cross
 *
 * Discovery reads the machine and runs whatever it finds, so its result is the one
 * place in this layer where a subprocess's own output becomes text the app repeats.
 * Two rules apply on the way out, and {@link summariseDiscovery} is where they are
 * enforced rather than hoped for:
 *
 * 1. **A fresh plain object, field by field.** Nothing the discovery layer returns is
 *    forwarded by reference. What crosses is built here from primitives, so a field
 *    added upstream reaches the renderer only when somebody decides it should.
 * 2. **Exactly one path per candidate, and it is the JDK's.** `executable` and `home`
 *    are structured path fields the settings row exists to show. `reason` is free text
 *    that can contain a rejected binary's entire stderr - a shim script's error naming
 *    a file in the user's profile, a `Command failed:` dump, a stack trace - so every
 *    absolute path in it is replaced before it leaves. The rejected candidate's own
 *    path is still on screen, in `executable`, one field away.
