/**
 * The Java toolchain layer: everything the app needs to run upstream BlueMap's
 * engine on a machine that may or may not have a JDK.
 *
 * Nothing in this directory is Java source. It is the TypeScript that finds, checks,
 * fetches and launches a JVM, and that locates the jars decisions D17 and D18 put at
 * the centre of local rendering.
 *
 * Deliberately free of any `electron` value import so the whole layer is unit-testable
 * without an Electron runtime. The one thing it needs from Electron is the `userData`
 * directory, and that is a parameter. `ipc.ts` names `IpcMain` as a *type* and takes it
 * as a parameter too, so that import is erased at build time and the rule holds.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { app } from "electron";
 * import { ensureJava, resolveCliJar } from "./java/index.js";
 *
 * const java = await ensureJava({ dataDir: app.getPath("userData") });
 * const cli = resolveCliJar({ resourcesPath: app.isPackaged ? process.resourcesPath : null });
 * // java.installation.executable  ->  the JVM to launch
 * // cli.path, cli.version         ->  the jar to hand it, and what it is
 * ```
