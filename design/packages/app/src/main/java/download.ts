/**
 * A resumable download that is verified before anybody is allowed to use it.
 *
 * A JDK is around 150-200 MB. On a hotel network that is several minutes, and losing
 * all of it because a laptop lid closed is the difference between a feature people
 * use and a feature people give up on. So the transfer lands in a `.part` file that
 * survives a restart, and a resumed transfer asks for a byte range rather than
 * starting again.
 *
 * Resuming is also the thing most likely to corrupt a file silently: append to the
 * wrong part file, or to the right one after the server changed the artefact behind
 * the URL, and the result is a plausible-looking archive of the correct size that is
 * garbage. Two defences against that. A sidecar records the URL and the expected
 * digest, and a part file whose sidecar does not match is discarded rather than
 * appended to. And the digest is verified over the *finished file on disk*, not over
 * the bytes as they streamed past, so a resumed download is checked end to end
 * including everything a previous attempt wrote.
 *
 * The verified name only ever appears via a rename of an already-verified part file,
 * so a file at the final path is always a file that passed.
