 * three layers away from anything that would point back here.
 *
 * This is overridable - the caller can pass a fresh `liveRiskAcknowledgement` nonce after
 * being shown this exact sentence - but never silently. What has **no** override is a *standing* one:
 * there is no setting, no flag defaulting to true, nothing that once accepted applies to
 * every world after the first. Every fetch of a live world is acknowledged fresh. See
 * `dockerworld/`'s own module doc for what a safe unattended route (an RCON `save-off`
