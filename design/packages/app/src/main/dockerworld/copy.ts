/**
 * Moving a world's bytes from wherever Docker has them to a folder this app can render.
 *
 * Three ways in, from `resolve.ts`'s three routes:
 *
 * - `bind-direct` reads a host path straight off a filesystem - this machine's own, or a
 *   remote one through the same `FileTransfer` the SSH lane already built. Region files
 *   rarely change between renders, so this is genuinely incremental: `localIncrementalCopy`
 *   compares size and modification time and copies only what differs, and a remote fetch
 *   gets the same property for free from rsync's `-a`, which does the same comparison.
 * - `container-copy` and `volume-copy` go through `docker cp` or a disposable helper
 *   container - Docker's own read, not this app's - into a **staging** directory, and only
 *   the placement step from staging into the destination is incremental. That is an honest
 *   limitation, not an oversight: Docker has no notion of "copy only what changed," so the
 *   read itself is always whole. What incrementality buys here is that a scheduled render
 *   which finds a volume unchanged does not rewrite files downstream of the destination -
 *   a git-tracked copy, a render cache - even though the `docker cp` still ran.
 *
 * **Never deletes.** Every copy here only adds and updates files; nothing removes a file
 * from the destination that disappeared at the source. A world that shrank (a region pruned,
 * a dimension removed) leaves a stale file behind rather than losing data to a bug in a
 * comparison - the file is inert and the next full re-render is undisturbed by its presence.
 * This is also why no destructive-action gate is needed anywhere in this module: nothing
 * it does is destructive.
