/**
 * The one channel that carries Mojang's EULA to the window.
 *
 * Built the way `main/update/ipc.ts` is built, for the same reasons: Electron arrives as a
 * *type* so this module is importable from a test without an Electron runtime, every
 * channel is named once so `dispose` cannot drift from the registration, and **the handler
 * never rejects**. A rejected `invoke` becomes an unhandled promise inside a component and
 * the user sees nothing at all - which, for a surface whose entire job is to show a legal
 * document, would be the worst possible failure: a blank panel with no explanation.
 *
 * So every failure crosses as a value: `ok: false`, a sentence the interface shows, and
 * the cached copy when one exists. The renderer decides what to display and how to label
 * it; this side's only obligation is never to describe a cached or missing document as a
 * live one.
 *
 * The document address is not a literal here. It is `MOJANG_EULA_URL` from `consent.ts` -
 * the same constant the consent record stores and refuses a mismatch against - so the
 * document somebody reads and the document their acceptance names cannot drift apart.
