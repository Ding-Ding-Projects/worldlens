/**
 * A world that lives on a remote host, fetched over the same SSH this folder already speaks.
 *
 * `remote/` already hands a render *to* a Linux machine and brings the map back. This is the
 * other direction: a world that already lives on a machine the person owns - reachable over
 * SSH, on Linux or on Windows - is read from where it is, rather than requiring it to be
 * zipped up and carried here first. It reuses this folder's connection, host-key verification
 * and transfer primitives rather than writing parallel ones:
 *
 * | What | Reused from |
 * |---|---|
 * | the connection, its security options, its quoting | `ssh.ts` |
 * | "is this host key trusted, unknown, or changed" | `hostkey.ts` |
 * | `scp`, and rsync with its `scp` fallback | `transfer.ts`, `rsync.ts` |
 * | every failure sentence | `failure.ts` |
 *
 * ## Two hosts, one honest difference
 *
 * A Linux host very likely has `rsync`, and `chooseTransfer` already prefers it: an
 * interrupted fetch of a Minecraft world's tens of thousands of small region files resumes
 * from where it stopped rather than starting the whole world over. A Windows host very
 * likely does **not** have `rsync` - it does not ship with Windows and is rarely installed -
 * so `chooseTransfer` falls back to `scp`, exactly as it already does for any host missing
 * either end of the pair, and says so in the message it returns. Nothing new was needed for
 * that: `chooseTransfer`'s own honesty is what this module leans on.
 *
 * What Windows needs that Linux does not is a way to even *ask* the question "what host is
 * this" and "what files does it have" without knowing in advance which shell is on the other
 * end of the connection. `windowsShell.ts` is that answer, and {@link surveyRemoteWorld} is
 * what uses it: a cheap listing of every file's size and modification time, which is enough
 * to say a world has not changed without transferring a single region file, on either
 * platform. That survey is also exactly the "cheap change check" a scheduled render wants to
 * run before deciding a render is worth starting at all - {@link diffRemoteWorldSurveys} and
 * {@link remoteWorldChanged} are pure functions, importable with no Electron runtime and no
 * network, for whatever drives that decision.
 *
 * ## What this module does not do
 *
 * It never writes to the remote host. A world source is read from; nothing here creates,
 * deletes or modifies a directory there, which is also why the Windows side needs no
 * PowerShell equivalent of `mkdir -p`/`rm -rf` - those exist in `transfer.ts` only because the
 * *render* side uploads a staging directory, and this module is the download-only mirror of
 * that, not a second copy of it.
