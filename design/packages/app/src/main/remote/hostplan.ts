/**
 * Where a hosted map lives on the remote host, and the exact command that serves it.
 *
 * A remote render (`plan.ts`) sends a world, runs it through the engine, brings the tiles
 * home, and removes everything it staged. Hosting is the mirror image of the upload half and
 * the opposite of the cleanup half: the world still has to go there - the engine builds a
 * real `BmMap` on every start, `-w` included, and that construction opens the world's own
 * region files whether or not anything is re-rendered (see `packages/cli/src/maps.ts`,
 * `buildMaps`) - but the *tiles* travel too, in the other direction, and the container this
 * plan describes is never meant to stop on its own.
 *
 * The staging layout is exactly `plan.ts`'s: `remotePaths` and `remoteWorldPath` are reused
 * unchanged rather than restated, because they already describe the right shape -
 * `config/`, `data/`, `web/` (with `web/maps` the storage root), `worlds/<mapId>/`,
 * `cli.jar` - and a second copy of that arithmetic is a second place for the two to drift.
 * What is genuinely different is only:
 *
 * - the container is started detached (`-d --restart unless-stopped`), never `--rm`, because
 *   this one is meant to outlive the SSH session that started it, on purpose;
 * - a port is published, deliberately, to an address the caller chooses out loud;
 * - the engine runs `-w` rather than `-r -s`.
