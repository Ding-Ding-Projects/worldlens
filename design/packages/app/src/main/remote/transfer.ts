/**
 * Moving the world there and the map back.
 *
 * `scp` rather than a library, for the same reason `ssh` is used rather than a library: it
 * uses the person's agent and their config, and this app never touches key material. It is
 * also, honestly, the slow part - `scp -r` opens a channel per file and a world is tens of
 * thousands of small region files - and the documentation says so rather than pretending
 * otherwise.
 *
 * ## What is an interface here, and why
 *
 * {@link FileTransfer} exists so that not one test in this folder needs a server. The
 * orchestrator asks for "put this directory there" and "bring that directory back"; whether
 * that is `scp`, a tar stream, or a fake that records what it was asked for is a decision
 * one layer down. The failure this prevents is the usual one: a cancellation path, a
 * cleanup path and a partial-transfer path that are only ever exercised against real
 * hardware, and therefore never exercised.
 *
 * `rsync.ts` is that door being used. It supplies a second {@link FileTransfer} that can
 * carry an interrupted file on from where it stopped - the one thing `scp` genuinely
 * cannot do - and falls back to this one, out loud, when either machine has no rsync. The
 * `scp` implementation below stays the floor under everything, including the guarded
 * remote delete and the `mkdir -p`, which rsync delegates back here rather than restating.
