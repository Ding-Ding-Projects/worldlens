/**
 * A transfer that can be interrupted and carried on, instead of one that starts again.
 *
 * ## The problem `scp` has, stated exactly
 *
 * `scp` has no notion of a partial file. A copy that stops at nine gigabytes of ten leaves
 * a nine-gigabyte file the next copy overwrites from byte zero. For a world folder on a
 * domestic connection that is not an inconvenience, it is the difference between a render
 * that happens and one that never does: every dropped connection costs the whole upload,
 * and the upload is longer than the interval between dropped connections.
 *
 * `transfer.ts` already says that its shape is a decision - that `scp`, a tar stream and a
 * fake are interchangeable behind {@link FileTransfer}. This is that door being used.
 *
 * ## Why `rsync`, and the three flags that matter
 *
 * ```
 * -a                  archive: recurse, keep times and permissions
 * --partial           keep a file that was cut off, instead of deleting it
 * --append-verify     carry a partial file on from where it stopped, after
 *                     checksumming the part that is already there
 * -e "<ssh ...>"      the same ssh, with the same security options as everything else
 * ```
 *
 * `--partial` alone only *keeps* the fragment; `--append-verify` is what makes the next run
 * use it. It reads the bytes already at the destination, checksums them against the same
 * range of the source, and appends only if they match - so a fragment from a file that has
 * since changed is re-sent whole rather than producing a file that is half one version and
 * half another. That verification is the reason plain `--append` is not used here: `--append`
 * trusts the fragment, and a world folder is exactly the kind of source that gets edited
 * between two attempts.
 *
 * ## Falling back, out loud
 *
 * rsync is not everywhere. Windows does not ship it, a minimal server image often does not
 * have it, and it has to be present on **both** ends because the protocol runs a copy of
 * itself on each. So it is detected rather than assumed - locally and remotely, separately,
 * because "you have it and the server does not" and "the server has it and you do not" are
 * different sentences with different fixes.
 *
 * When it is missing, or when a transfer through it fails for a reason that is about rsync
 * rather than about the file, the copy is made with `scp` instead and **the log says so, in
 * a sentence that names what is being given up**. A transfer that quietly degrades to
 * restart-from-zero is worse than one that never offered to resume, because somebody
 * planning around a resumable upload has no way to find out it is not one.
 *
 * ### The `-e` string is the sharp edge, and it is why the fallback is at use time
 *
 * rsync takes the remote shell as **one string** and splits it itself. This app's known
 * hosts file lives under the application data directory, which on Windows is
 * `...\Worldlens\known_hosts` - a path with a space in it. Whether a given rsync
 * build honours the quotes around that is a property of that build, not something that can
 * be decided here, so it is not decided here: the words are quoted, and a failure is caught
 * and answered with `scp` and an explanation rather than with a refusal.
