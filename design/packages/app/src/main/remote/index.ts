/**
 * Rendering on a machine that is better at it than this one.
 *
 * A world goes over SSH to a Linux host, a container renders it there, and the map comes
 * back. The interface reports it exactly as it reports a local render, because it *is* the
 * local reporting: the same `RenderEvent` union, the same `RenderOutputTracker`, the same
 * `EngineProcess`, the same cancellation.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {
 *     RemoteRenderOrchestrator, registerRemoteHandlers, validateTarget, preflight,
 * } from "./remote/index.js";
 *
 * const orchestrator = new RemoteRenderOrchestrator({
 *     storageDir: () => render.storageDirectory(),
 *     resolveEngine,
 *     hasConsent: hasAcceptedDownload,
 *     onEvent: broadcastRenderEvent,          // the SAME channel a local render uses
 *     knownHostsFile: join(app.getPath("userData"), "known_hosts"),
 *     userKnownHostsFile: join(homedir(), ".ssh", "known_hosts"),
 * });
 * const remote = registerRemoteHandlers(ipcMain, {
 *     orchestrator,
 *     knownHostsFile: join(app.getPath("userData"), "known_hosts"),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## What this folder will not do
 *
 * - **ask for or store a password.** There is no field for one and the SSH options make the
 *   client refuse one even when a host offers it. Authentication is an agent or a key file
 *   named by path; no key is ever read, copied or written by this app.
 * - **trust an unknown host key.** `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`, always. An unknown key is a
 *   refusal with fingerprints attached for the person to compare; a *changed* key is a
 *   refusal with no button at all.
 * - **leave a copy of somebody's world on a server without saying so.** The staging
 *   directory is removed when the render ends - succeeded, failed or cancelled - and the
 *   one setting that keeps it says out loud what it keeps.
 *
 * `ipc.ts` is the one module here that names Electron, and only as a type. Everything else
 * takes its command runner, its transfer and its preflight as parameters, which is what
 * lets the whole flow be tested with no SSH client, no container runtime and no network.
