/**
 * Hosting an already-rendered map on a Linux server the person owns, over SSH, in Docker.
 *
 * A remote **render** (`orchestrator.ts`) sends a world, runs it once, brings the tiles
 * home and removes every trace of itself. Hosting is the feature this application did not
 * have before: put a finished map on a server so somebody else can open it, and leave it
 * running.
 *
 * ```
 * 1  preflight     ssh, host key, Docker, disk - exactly `preflight.ts`, reused unchanged
 * 2  stage         (re)create <workDir>/host-<hostingId>/ on the remote host
 * 3  config        written HERE with CONTAINER paths, role "web-server", then uploaded
 * 4  upload        the engine jar, each map's world, and the already-rendered `web/` root
 * 5  replace       any previous container of this name is torn down, so republishing is
 *                  idempotent rather than a "name already in use" refusal
 * 6  serve         `docker run -d --restart unless-stopped ...` - detached, on purpose
 * 7  verify        the published address is genuinely connected to before it is reported
 * 8  record        a durable note of what is running, where, so it can be found again
 * ```
 *
 * ## "Live" is not a claim made on Docker's say-so
 *
 * `docker run -d` reports success the instant the container starts, which is not the same
 * fact as "a browser can reach this map" - the exact distinction `docker-and-local.md`
 * draws for the local web server, and that this module draws for a remote one, with one
 * wrinkle a local server never has: **two different networks can fail**, and the report has
 * to say which one did.
 *
 * - **`bindMode: "public"`** publishes to every interface on the remote host, so this
 *   computer connects to it directly, over the real internet, the same way anybody else
 *   would. {@link RemoteHostingOrchestratorOptions.probe} (default: the same `tcpPortProbe`
 *   the local web server proves itself with) is what does that connecting.
 * - **`bindMode: "loopback"`** publishes only to the remote host's own loopback address,
 *   which this computer cannot reach directly at all - that is the whole point of choosing
 *   it. So the check runs *on the remote host*, over the SSH connection already open for
 *   everything else: a small script asks that machine's own kernel whether something is
 *   listening on `127.0.0.1:<port>`, and the answer travels home over the channel that is
 *   already trusted.
 *
 * Both paths distinguish "the container never bound the port" from "the port is bound and
 * this application's own network cannot reach it" wherever the evidence allows it, the same
 * way `ssh.ts` already distinguishes ssh's own failure from the remote command's.
 *
 * ## What never happens here
 *
 * The same three promises `orchestrator.ts` makes: no password, ever; an unknown host key is
 * a refusal with fingerprints attached, never a silent trust; and a copy of somebody's world
 * sitting on a server is a fact stated out loud, not a detail. Hosting adds one more: a
 * published port is exactly the address the person chose, in exactly the words they were
 * shown before pressing the button - never guessed at, never silently widened.
