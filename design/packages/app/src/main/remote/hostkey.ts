/**
 * The host key, which is the one question this app refuses to answer on somebody's behalf.
 *
 * SSH's whole guarantee rests on knowing that the machine answering is the machine that
 * answered last time. `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` throws that away for the *first*
 * connection to any host - which is precisely the connection an interceptor needs to
 * survive, because after it the wrong key is the recorded key and every later connection
 * looks fine. So this app connects with `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`, an unknown host is a
 * refusal, and the refusal is turned into a decision with a fingerprint in front of it.
 *
 * ## Three states, and only one of them has a button
 *
 * ```
 * trusted    the key is already in a known_hosts this app reads. Nothing to ask.
 * unknown    never seen. Show the fingerprints; the person decides. Nothing is sent.
 * changed    seen, and different. REFUSED, with no button anywhere.
 * ```
 *
 * `changed` has no button because a rebuilt server and an intercepted connection are
 * indistinguishable from here, and a button that resolves that ambiguity in the app's
 * favour is a button that resolves it in an attacker's favour too. Removing a recorded key
 * is a deliberate act with a file path in it, and the message says so.
 *
 * ## Why the approval is re-scanned rather than taken at its word
 *
 * {@link trustHostKey} does **not** accept a key blob from the caller and write it. It
 * scans the host again, computes the fingerprints itself, and writes a line only if one of
 * them equals the fingerprint the person approved. Otherwise the renderer - the least
 * trusted process in the application - would be one IPC message away from appending an
 * arbitrary line to a trust store, which is a longer way round to the same compromise.
