/**
 * Handing a render to another machine, and reporting it as if it never left.
 *
 * The promise this file has to keep is narrow and specific: **the interface cannot tell**.
 * A remote render emits `RenderEvent` - the same union `render/orchestrator.ts` emits - so
 * the same progress bar, the same log pane, the same cancel button and the same failure
 * banner work with no knowledge that a network was involved. That is not achieved by
 * copying the event shapes; it is achieved by using them, and by running the container's
 * output through the same `RenderOutputTracker` the local path uses.
 *
 * ## The order of the steps is the design
 *
 * ```
 * 1  preflight     ssh, host key, Docker, disk. Nothing is sent until all four pass.
 * 2  stage         create <workDir>/<renderId>/ on the remote host
 * 3  config        written HERE with CONTAINER paths in it, then uploaded
 * 4  upload        the engine jar, then each world
 * 5  render        ssh -> docker run, output read line by line as it arrives
 * 6  collect       bring <web>/maps home into this render's own workspace
 * 7  clean up      remove <workDir>/<renderId>/ unless the target says to keep it
 * ```
 *
 * Preflight is first for the same reason consent is first in the local orchestrator: a
 * failure that costs nothing must cost nothing. Uploading six gigabytes and *then*
 * discovering the host has no Docker is a wasted evening, and the person would rightly
 * read it as the app not having bothered to look.
 *
 * ## What leaves this machine, said plainly
 *
 * The world folders named in the request, the engine jar, and a config file naming the maps.
 * Nothing else: not a token, not a key, not the app's settings, not any other world. What is
 * left behind afterwards is nothing, unless the target has `keepRemoteFiles` on - and then
 * the interface says so, because a copy of somebody's world sitting on a server is a fact
 * they are entitled to know rather than a detail.
 *
 * ## Cancelling stops the container, not the conversation
 *
 * `EngineProcess` from `runtime/` is what runs the SSH child, and it is given a
 * `stopContainer` that asks the **remote daemon** to stop the container by name. Killing the
 * local `ssh` would end the log and leave the JVM rendering into somebody's disk with
 * nothing holding a handle to it. Cleanup then runs on the way out, so a cancelled render
 * does not leave a staging directory behind either.
 *
 * ## Closing the app is not cancelling either, which is why the container's name is written down
 *
 * The same fact from the other side: if killing `ssh` does not stop the container, then
 * *quitting* does not stop it, and a render that was going when the app closed is still
 * going when it opens again. Before the container is started its name, its host and where
 * its output belongs are written to `container.json` beside the render
 * (`runtime/handoff.ts`), and the note is removed on every way out of a run. That note is
 * the whole difference between reattaching to a six-hour render and starting a second one
 * beside it; `remote/reattach.ts` is what reads it.
 *
 * ## The world is sent with rsync where both machines have it
 *
 * `scp` cannot carry a partial file on, so an interrupted upload of a large world starts
 * that file again from zero. `rsync.ts` detects rsync on both ends and uses it when it is
 * there, and the log says which tool moved the files and what an interruption would cost -
 * a transfer that quietly degrades to restart-from-zero is worse than one that never
 * offered to resume.
