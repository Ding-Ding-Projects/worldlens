/**
 * The world-source channel between the main process and the wizard.
 *
 * Built like `runtime/ipc.ts` and `java/ipc.ts`: Electron arrives as a *type*, `IpcMain`
 * is a parameter, and the import is erased at build time, so every channel below is
 * exercised in tests with no Electron runtime and no network anywhere near them. Every
 * channel is named once in {@link WORLD_SOURCE_CHANNELS}, so `dispose` cannot drift from
 * the registration.
 *
 * **No handler here rejects.** The question these channels answer is "can I get a world
 * from that release?", and every possible answer - including "that is not a repository" -
 * is a sentence the wizard has to show. A rejection would arrive at the renderer as a bare
 * `Error` with a stack in it, and the step would have to guess what to say.
 *
 * Progress is broadcast on the **download channel**, not on one of this module's own. A
 * world fetched from somebody else's repository is a download like any other, appears in
 * the same list, is cancelled by the same button and is reported by the same row. A second
 * event channel would mean a second list, and a download in one of them is a download the
 * other cannot see or stop.
