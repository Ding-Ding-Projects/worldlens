/**
 * Fetching a world out of *anybody's* release, in whichever way they published it.
 *
 * This is the release downloader's cross-repository twin, and it is deliberately thin:
 * everything that was already solved is reused rather than restated.
 *
 * - the release lookup, the account lease and the CDN-versus-API URL choice come from
 *   `download/release.ts`;
 * - the resumable ranged transfer comes from `download/http.ts`;
 * - the safe unpack comes from `download/extract.ts`;
 * - the join, with its per-part re-check and its resume, comes from
 *   `@worldlens/parts` - the same joiner `scripts/join-parts.mjs` runs;
 * - the event shapes, the failure codes and the on-disk workspace come from
 *   `download/`, so a world fetched from somebody else's repository is reported by the
 *   interface exactly as one fetched from this one.
 *
 * What is genuinely new is one thing: a release whose split is described by a `SHA256SUMS`
 * rather than by a `<name>.parts.json`. A split published the way this project publishes
 * one is handed straight to {@link ReleaseDownloader}, which already does it and already
 * does it better - it has the publisher's own whole-file digest, and this path does not.
 *
 * ## The order of the steps is the design
 *
 * 1. read the release, from whichever repository was named;
 * 2. fetch the checksum list first - it is a few hundred bytes and it is the only thing
 *    that says what the parts are supposed to be;
 * 3. fetch every part, with `Range` resume and a concurrency cap;
 * 4. hash every part in join order, checking each against the published digest and
 *    deriving the whole-file digest in the same pass;
 * 5. join, which re-checks each part as it appends and then checks the whole;
 * 6. unpack.
 *
 * Nothing downstream of step 4 runs on unverified bytes, and a part that failed its digest
 * is deleted before it is re-fetched, because it is the one file on disk that must not be
 * resumed into.
 *
 * A **failure** deletes the joined archive and the unpacked tree - the two things that look
 * finished to whatever comes next - and keeps the parts, which are individually checksummed
 * and safe to resume from. A **cancellation** keeps everything, including the half-written
 * part: that is the point of a resumable download, and a cancellation is not a failure.
