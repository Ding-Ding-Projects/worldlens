/**
 * Working out why a render or the web server would not start, and fixing what can be fixed.
 *
 * Two halves, in this order and never the other way round:
 *
 * 1. `diagnose.ts` decides every failure this project already knows the shape of - a port
 *    in use, no Java, Java too old, an unreadable world, an unwritable output folder, the
 *    Mojang download not accepted, an out-of-memory kill, a config BlueMap itself refused.
 *    No model is involved in any of it.
 * 2. `agent.ts` and `pass.ts` hand what is left to a local coding agent, if one is
 *    installed and the user has switched it on, inside the guardrails in `guardrails.ts`:
 *    config files only, in this run's config folder only, writes only, never a deletion,
 *    never a git command, never the world.
 *
 * Every automatic change is recorded in the app's own version history before it is
 * reported, and is shown afterwards as a plain diff with what changed and why.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { collectEvidence, registerRepairHandlers } from "./repair/index.js";
 *
 * const repair = registerRepairHandlers(ipcMain, { allowAgent: () => settings.autoRepair });
 * // ...when a run fails:
 * const id = repair.remember(collectEvidence({ ... }));
 * ```
