/**
 * The repair channel between the main process and the interface.
 *
 * Built like `config/ipc.ts`: Electron arrives as a *type*, `IpcMain` is a parameter, the
 * import is erased at build time, and every channel is named once in
 * {@link REPAIR_CHANNELS} so `dispose` cannot drift from the registration.
 *
 * ## The renderer names a failure; it never describes one
 *
 * Evidence is put here by the main process, at the moment a run fails, and the renderer
 * gets an id back. Every channel below takes that id. The alternative - letting the
 * renderer send an evidence record - would let whatever is running in that window choose
 * the config folder a repair writes into, choose which world folders are "not to be
 * touched", and choose what the agent is told. The guardrails would still refuse an edit
 * outside the folder, but the folder itself would be the renderer's to name, which is the
 * one input they cannot check.
 *
 * **No handler rejects.** Every answer is a value with an `ok` on it, because each one is
 * something the interface has to render: an unknown id, a repair that changed nothing, and
 * a repair that changed two files are three states of one panel.
