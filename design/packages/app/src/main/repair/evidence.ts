/**
 * What was actually observed when a run failed.
 *
 * Everything the repair pass does is a decision about this record, and the record is
 * assembled once, at the moment of the failure, from the things that stop being true
 * afterwards: the exit code, the last lines the engine printed, the config that was in
 * force *then* rather than after somebody edited it, which Java was used, what Docker
 * said, which port was refused. A diagnosis made from a config re-read ten seconds later
 * is a diagnosis of a different failure.
 *
 * ## Secrets never leave this record intact
 *
 * A BlueMap config folder can hold database credentials: `storages/*.conf` carries a JDBC
 * URL and a `connection-properties` block with a user name and a password in it. This
 * evidence is shown on screen, copied into bug reports, and - when the deterministic
 * diagnosis comes up empty - put into a prompt for a local coding agent that may send it
 * to whatever model it is configured to use.
 *
 * So {@link redactSecrets} runs over every piece of config text before it is stored here,
 * not on the way out. Redacting on the way out means one caller who forgets, and a
 * password in a screenshot. The keys are masked and the structure is kept, which is what
 * a diagnosis needs: "the password is set" and "the password is `hunter2`" are the same
 * fact for every purpose this module has.
