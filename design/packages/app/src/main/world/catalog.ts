/**
 * Every world inside a `saves` folder, with the facts somebody chooses one by.
 *
 * The wizard's first step used to be a path field and nothing else, which asks the person
 * to know where Minecraft keeps its saves and to type it correctly. This is the other
 * half: hand it a `saves` folder and it reports the worlds in it, each with its real name,
 * when it was last played, the version it was last opened with, what kind of game it is,
 * which dimensions have terrain, and how much disk it occupies.
 *
 * ## What is a world, and what is quietly not
 *
 * A subdirectory is a world when it contains a `level.dat`. Anything else in a `saves`
 * folder - a stray `screenshots` copy, a backup archive, an editor's scratch directory -
 * is left out entirely, because listing it would offer somebody a render that cannot
 * start.
 *
 * A directory that *does* have a `level.dat` is always listed, even when that file turns
 * out to be unreadable. It keeps its folder name, its dimensions and its size, and
 * carries the reason the rest is missing, so a world with one corrupt file is something
 * the person can see and reason about rather than a world that mysteriously vanished from
 * a list they know it should be in.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * Reading a saves folder must stay cheap enough to do on every visit to step one, and a
 * mature world holds tens of thousands of files. Three things keep it bounded: the
 * structural read is `inspect.ts`, which counts region files from directory entries and
 * never stats one; the `level.dat` read skips the dimension registry rather than decoding
 * it; and the size walk stops at {@link MAX_SIZE_ENTRIES} files and says so, so the
 * reported size is either complete or honestly labelled as a floor.
