/**
 * The main-process copy of the server-profile / maps-and-servers list.
 *
 * `design/packages/ui/src/stores/profiles.ts` is the renderer's own copy of this same idea,
 * and it is the one the interface actually reads and writes today - straight to the
 * browser's `localStorage`, which the main process cannot see and therefore cannot keep a
 * history of. This module is the other half of the fix Issue #35 asks for: a place in the
 * main process this data can *also* live, on disk, beside the application's own data, so the
 * history machinery in `../history/` has something real to snapshot.
 *
 * It is deliberately not a re-export of anything in `packages/ui`. That package renders three
 * different places - a browser tab, a test runner, the Electron renderer - and none of them
 * is this process; borrowing its types would borrow an assumption about Vue reactivity this
 * file has no business making. The shape here is the plain data the renderer's `ServerProfile`
 * already is, restated as an ordinary interface with no framework attached.
 *
 * ## Where the file lives, and why it is a real directory rather than a bare file path
 *
 * `profilesFolder(dataDir)` is a real directory - `<userData>/profiles-store/` - holding
 * exactly one file, `profiles.json`. A directory rather than a lone file so the same
 * `HistorySource` shape every other history binding uses (`read`/`write`/`remove` against a
 * *folder*) applies unchanged in `history.ts`: there is one kind of "where does this live"
 * argument in the whole history system, not a special case for things that happen to be a
 * single file.
 *
 * ## Reading is tolerant, writing is not
 *
 * {@link readProfilesState} degrades every failure - a missing file, a truncated one, one
 * edited by hand into nonsense - to the empty state, for the same reason
 * `history/store.ts`'s `readIndex` does: this file is a convenience the application maintains
 * for itself, and refusing to start because of a stray character in it would turn a cosmetic
 * problem into an outage. {@link writeProfilesState} has no such tolerance to offer, because
 * by the time something is writing, the shape has already been checked - that check belongs
 * to `ipc.ts`, which is the boundary a renderer's untrusted JSON actually crosses.
