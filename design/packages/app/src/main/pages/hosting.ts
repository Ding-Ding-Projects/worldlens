/**
 * Putting a locally rendered map on GitHub Pages, from the application, end to end.
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * A render finishes and the map is served at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/local/<renderId>/`,
 * which is a URL nobody else can open. Showing it to somebody means either leaving this
 * computer running as a web server or copying a tile tree by hand into a repository and
 * hoping the viewer can still find its files. This is the second of those, done properly:
 * one action that prepares the render for a dumb static host, pushes it, turns Pages on,
 * waits for the build and then **fetches the published URL to check it really answers**.
 *
 * ## The fact the whole feature rests on
 *
 * `@worldlens/render-actions`'s `prepareStaticHost` carries the explanation in full,
 * and it is worth repeating in one line because everything here is downstream of it: the
 * engine writes `0.prbm.gz`, the viewer asks for `0.prbm`, and only a web server that
 * rewrites the name makes those two agree. GitHub Pages does not rewrite anything. So the
 * viewer has to be told to ask for the compressed names and inflate them itself, and this
 * module refuses to publish a map where flipping that switch would point the viewer at
 * files nobody wrote.
 *
 * ## Where the git directory lives, and why the render output is still safe
 *
 * There is no `.git` inside the render output, ever. The repository lives in the
 * application's own work area, and every git command names it explicitly:
 *
 * ```
 * git -C <webRoot> --git-dir=<workDir>/.git --work-tree=<webRoot> ...
 * ```
 *
 * The alternative - copying the tile tree into a staging directory first - was rejected on
 * arithmetic rather than taste. A rendered map is routinely several gigabytes across tens of
 * thousands of small files, and copying it doubles both the disk it needs and the time before
 * anything is pushed, to produce a byte-for-byte duplicate of a directory that is already
 * sitting there. Git never writes into a work tree during `add`, `commit` or `push`, so the
 * only thing this puts into the render output is the marker file below, beside the
 * `.nojekyll` that `prepareStaticHost` already writes there.
 *
 * ## The marker, which is the guard that stops this eating somebody's repository
 *
 * Every publish writes {@link PAGES_MARKER_FILE} at the site root, naming this tool, the
 * render and the maps it carries. Before anything is pushed, and again before anything is
 * deleted, the target branch is read: **if the branch exists and does not carry that marker,
 * this refuses**. A publishing branch is force-replaced on every run - a republished map is a
 * replacement, and keeping the history of a million tiles would grow a repository without
 * bound - so without that check one wrong repository name would destroy somebody's site with
 * no way back. It is the one guard in this file that has no fallback and no override.
 *
 * ## Honesty
 *
 * `status` is what GitHub said, and `verified` is true only when a request to the published
 * URL came back `200`. "Queued" and "building" are reported as themselves. A push is reported
 * as landed only after the branch on GitHub is read back and its head matches the commit that
 * was just made. Nothing here guesses, and nothing here waits a while and then assumes.
 *
 * ## Secrets
 *
 * No token is read, held, logged or passed as an argument. Authentication for both the API
 * and the push is `gh`'s own credential store, reached through `gh api` and through git's
 * `credential.helper` mechanism pointed at `gh auth git-credential` for the one command that
 * needs it. `gh auth login` is never driven from here - see `cirender/gh.ts` for why that is
 * a hard-won rule rather than a preference.
