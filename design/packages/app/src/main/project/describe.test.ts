/**
 * How one project save is worded, which is the difference between a history panel somebody
 * uses and one they scroll past.
 *
 * Every assertion here is about a row somebody will read months later, looking for the
 * moment something changed. A list of forty rows all reading "Saved the project" is an
 * archive: finding the save that deleted the nether map means opening rows one at a time.
 * The whole of this file exists so that row reads "Deleted the nether map" instead.
