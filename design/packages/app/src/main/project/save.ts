/**
 * Saving a project: the write, then the record of it, in that order and never the reverse.
 *
 * The ordering is the whole of this file. The write is what the person asked for; the
 * revision is the application's own bookkeeping. Recording first would mean a history
 * holding a revision for a save that then failed - a row describing an event that did not
 * happen, in the one panel whose value is that its rows are true.
 *
 * ## A failed history write never fails the save
 *
 * The file is on disk by the time the snapshot is attempted, and nothing after that point
 * can un-save it. So a history failure comes back as `historyOk: false` beside `ok: true`,
 * with the sentence to show, and the caller is left holding a result that says plainly:
 * your project is saved, and this build could not keep a record of it. Collapsing those two
 * into one boolean would force the interface to choose between telling somebody their save
 * failed when it did not, and hiding a broken history until they need it.
