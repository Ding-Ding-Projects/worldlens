/**
 * Reading, writing and finding a project file inside somebody's Minecraft world.
 *
 * The shape of a project is fixed elsewhere - `@worldlens/config` owns the schema,
 * the file name, the format version, and the pure text-to-project reader. Nothing here
 * re-decides any of that. This module is the other half of that seam: the only code in the
 * application allowed to put a byte inside a world folder, written the way `config/ipc.ts`
 * is written, for the same reasons and with the same suspicion.
 *
 * ## Why writing here is treated as more dangerous than writing anywhere else
 *
 * A BlueMap config folder is a folder somebody made for BlueMap. A Minecraft world folder
 * is not: it holds the only copy of a world that may have taken years, and Minecraft is
 * writing to it too. Three rules follow, and each of them exists because of a specific way
 * this could go wrong.
 *
 *  1. **The write is atomic.** The text goes to a unique temporary file beside the target and
 *     is then renamed over it, with a short bounded retry for transient Windows sharing.
 *     A crash, a full disk, or a process kill cannot leave a half-written project that parses
 *     as neither the old settings nor the new ones. The reader sees one complete file.
 *  2. **Nothing is clobbered that was not first read and understood.** A file this build
 *     cannot parse is a file whose contents it cannot claim to be replacing. It might be a
 *     project written by a newer app, and overwriting one of those silently discards every
 *     setting this build does not model - which is exactly the failure
 *     {@link PROJECT_FORMAT_VERSION} exists to prevent, arriving through the back door.
 *     A damaged file can still be replaced, but only when the caller says so in as many
 *     words, and a `too-new` one cannot be replaced at all.
 *  3. **Only one path is ever written.** The file name is a constant and the world folder
 *     is checked before anything is joined onto it, so there is no argument any caller can
 *     send that makes this module touch a second file, a parent directory, or a link
 *     pointing somewhere else entirely.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * No history, no IPC, no Electron. `history.ts` binds a save to the version history and
 * `ipc.ts` is the only file in this directory that names a channel, so everything below can
 * be - and is - tested against real temporary directories with nothing else running.
