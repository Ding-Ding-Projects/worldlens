/**
 * The project channel between the main process and the interface.
 *
 * Built to the same shape as `config/ipc.ts` and `history/ipc.ts`, deliberately and method
 * for method: Electron arrives as a *type*, `IpcMain` is a parameter, and every channel is
 * named once in {@link PROJECT_CHANNELS} so `dispose` cannot drift from the registration.
 * The whole layer is therefore exercised by tests with no Electron runtime anywhere near
 * them, against real world folders in real temporary directories.
 *
 * ## Nothing on this channel rejects
 *
 * Every handler resolves, always, with a value that describes what happened - including
 * every refusal. That is structural rather than a convention, and it carries two different
 * weights here.
 *
 * A *history* failure must not fail a save, which is the rule `history/ipc.ts` is shaped
 * around, and it applies unchanged: the project file is on disk before a revision is
 * attempted, and no problem with git can un-save it.
 *
 * A *write* refusal is the other half, and it is the one specific to this channel. Refusing
 * to overwrite a project file this build cannot read is not an error condition, it is the
 * correct answer, and the interface has to be able to tell it apart from a disk that is
 * full. A thrown `Error` crossing the bridge arrives as one string with no shape to it; a
 * value carries the failure's kind, so "this world's project was made by a newer version of
 * the app" can be its own screen rather than a red toast with a sentence in it.
 *
 * ## The world folder is the capability
 *
 * The renderer names a world folder and nothing else. The file name is a constant, the
 * repository path is derived inside the main process, and {@link checkWorldFolder} refuses
 * a relative path or one that steps out of a folder with `..`. There is no argument the
 * renderer can send that makes this layer write to a second file, and the only path it ever
 * writes is the project at the root of the folder it named.
 *
 * ## Local only
 *
 * There is no channel here for a remote, a fetch, a push or a clone. {@link
 * ProjectHistoryListing} carries the repository's remote list precisely so the interface can
 * *show* that it is empty rather than promise it.
