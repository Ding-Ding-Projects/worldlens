/**
 * Binding a project save to the version history that already exists.
 *
 * Nothing about revisions is re-invented here. `history/` owns the append-only rules, the
 * isolation from the machine's git configuration, the drift capture before a restore, and
 * the rule that a failed history write is a value rather than a rejection. This file is the
 * adapter that lets all of it operate on a world's project file, and it is short because
 * that is the whole point: a second implementation would be the one that quietly stops
 * matching the first.
 *
 * ## The repository is never inside the world
 *
 * This is the clause that matters most, and a world folder makes it matter more than a
 * config folder did. Creating a `.git` inside somebody's world would put an object store
 * next to their region files, change what every backup tool and sync client sees, and grow
 * without bound beside the one directory a person cannot afford to have go wrong. So the
 * repository lives beside the application's own data, exactly as `history/store.ts`
 * describes, and the only thing this ever writes into the world is the project file itself.
 *
 * ## Its own family of repositories
 *
 * Project histories live under {@link PROJECT_HISTORY_DIRECTORY}, not beside the config
 * ones. A repository is a *complete* mirror - `mirrorInto` deletes whatever it was not
 * handed - so one repository holding both a config folder and a project would have each
 * snapshot record the other's disappearance. Two roots make that impossible rather than
 * unlikely, which it needs to be: the folder somebody points the config editor at and the
 * world they render are allowed to be the same directory.
 *
 * ## One revision per save
 *
 * A save records exactly one revision. A restore records two - what was on disk first, then
 * the restore itself - because a restore overwrites a state nobody chose to replace and the
 * safety net has to go up before the fall. A save is the person deliberately replacing what
 * they were looking at, so it needs no second row; the cost, stated plainly, is that a
 * project edited outside this app and then saved over inside it loses the outside edit from
 * the history. Restoring is where that case is defended, because that is where it happens.
