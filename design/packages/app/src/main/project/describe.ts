/**
 * Turning one project save into a sentence somebody recognises months later.
 *
 * `history/describe.ts` already does this for a config folder, and does it by looking at
 * which *files* changed. That reading is useless for a project, because a project is one
 * file: every save would produce the row "Changed worldlens.project.json", forty
 * times over, which is the word "Updated" wearing a longer name. A history panel full of
 * those is an archive nobody opens.
 *
 * So the description here is computed from the two projects themselves - the one the last
 * revision recorded and the one being saved - and names what actually moved inside the file:
 * a map added, a storage removed, the render options changed, the project renamed.
 *
 * ## Why this file is pure
 *
 * Two projects in, a label and an action out. No git, no disk, no clock. Every phrasing
 * decision below is therefore covered by an ordinary unit test, and changing the wording is
 * a diff somebody can read rather than a behaviour somebody has to run the app to observe.
