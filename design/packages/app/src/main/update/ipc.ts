/**
 * The update channel between the main process and the banner.
 *
 * Built like `main/config/ipc.ts`, method for method: Electron arrives as a *type*,
 * `IpcMain` is a parameter, every channel is named once in {@link UPDATE_CHANNELS} so
 * `dispose` cannot drift from the registration, and **no handler rejects**. A refusal is a
 * value with a code and a sentence, because a rejected `invoke` in the renderer becomes an
 * unhandled promise somewhere in a component, and the user sees nothing at all.
 *
 * ## What crosses, and what deliberately does not
 *
 * The state object, field by field: the versions, the status, the failure, the feed
 * *address*. What never crosses is the credential - `UpdateState.feedUrl` comes from
 * `describeFeed`, which exists for exactly this reason, and there is no channel here that
 * could return a header. A test asserts it, because a token that leaks into a state object
 * is invisible until somebody pastes a screenshot into an issue.
 *
 * ## Why a push channel as well as a pull one
 *
 * A check takes as long as the network does, and a download takes as long as the release
 * is big. A renderer that could only ask "what is the state" would have to poll, and
 * polling an updater means either a stale banner or a timer nobody needs. The main process
 * pushes every change on {@link UPDATE_EVENT_CHANNEL}; `update:state` exists so a window
 * that has just opened knows where things stand without waiting for the next change.
