/**
 * The thing that actually drives the updater, and the only part of it that has state.
 *
 * Everything an update *decides* lives next door in pure modules: `feed.ts` decides where
 * to look, `state.ts` decides what a result means, `schedule.ts` decides when to look
 * again, `failure.ts` decides what an error was. This module owns the two things that
 * cannot be pure - a live updater object and a clock - and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Nothing here interrupts anybody
 *
 * The download runs in the background and the app never restarts itself. Electron's
 * `autoUpdater` fetches and stages on its own; installation happens only inside
 * {@link UpdateController.restart}, only when the user asks, and only when
 * {@link UpdateControllerOptions.renderInProgress} says no render is in flight.
 *
 * A render is treated exactly as unsaved work: a BlueMap render of a large world runs for
 * hours, and quitting into an installer half way through throws that time away with no
 * route back to it. So the refusal is a *value* rather than an exception, it names the
 * render as the reason, and the banner shows it before the button is pressed rather than
 * after.
 *
 * ## Nothing here rejects
 *
 * Every method returns a value, failures included. An updater whose Check button can throw
 * is an updater whose Check button can leave a spinner running forever, and "the app looks
 * frozen" is the failure this whole subsystem exists to avoid producing.
