/**
 * Why an update did not happen, in words somebody can act on.
 *
 * Electron's `autoUpdater` reports every one of its problems the same way - an `error`
 * event carrying an `Error` whose message came from Squirrel, from WinINet, or from the
 * HTTP stack underneath. Those messages are accurate and useless: "hash of downloaded file
 * does not match" tells a person nothing about what to do, and "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND"
 * tells them nothing at all.
 *
 * So every failure is classified once, here, into a code the interface can key off and a
 * sentence a person can read. The classification is deliberately conservative: an error
 * that matches no rule becomes `unknown` and keeps its original text as `detail`, because
 * inventing a confident wrong diagnosis is worse than admitting the app does not recognise
 * this one.
 *
 * The failure this file exists to prevent is the silent one. An update that cannot be
 * checked, downloaded or verified must never look like an update that is simply not there
 * yet: the first needs the user's attention and the second does not, and a spinner that
 * never resolves is how both end up looking identical.
