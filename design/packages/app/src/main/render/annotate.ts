/**
 * This app's advice beside the engine's own output.
 *
 * BlueMap's CLI prints lines that are correct and unhelpful. `Address already in use`
 * is exactly true and tells a person nothing about what to do; `Start updating 0 maps
 * ...` is reported at INFO and is almost always a misconfigured map rather than good
 * news. The knowledge that closes those gaps exists, and until now it existed only in
 * the heads of people who had already hit them.
 *
 * So it is encoded here, as a **table** of `(pattern -> advice kind)` rather than as
 * conditionals scattered through a stream handler. The table shape is the point: a rule
 * can be read, tested and argued about on its own, a new one is three lines, and nothing
 * about adding one can change what the four beside it match. Conditionals grown one at a
 * time inside `RenderOutputTracker.interpret` would have exactly the opposite property.
 *
 * ## What this may and may not do
 *
 * It never touches the engine's line. `quoted` is the message exactly as it arrived, and
 * the advice sits beside it. That separation is the whole contract: the fact is the
 * engine's, the advice is this app's, and a reader can always see which is which. An
 * annotator that rewrote the engine's sentence would be destroying the one string a
 * person could search the internet for.
 *
 * It also carries no prose. A `kind` and the values captured out of the line are what
 * comes out, because the main process has no locale, no language mode and no funny
 * level, and a sentence chosen here would be an English sentence chosen for a person who
 * may have asked for Cantonese. The renderer owns the words; this owns the recognition.
 *
 * ## The renderer keeps its own copy of the table
 *
 * `packages/ui/src/components/console/annotations.ts` holds the same four rules, because
 * `packages/ui` and `packages/app` compile under separate `rootDir`s with no module
 * either can import from the other, exactly as `ui/.../world/worldBridge.ts` restates the
 * failure and event types rather than importing them. **A pattern changed here has to be
 * changed there**, and each side's tests fix its own behaviour against the same sample
 * lines so a drift shows up as a failing test rather than as advice that appears in one
 * build and not the other.
