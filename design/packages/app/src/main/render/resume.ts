/**
 * Finding a render that was cut off, and starting it again where it stopped.
 *
 * ## Resuming is a re-run, not a replay
 *
 * There is no checkpoint format here and there is deliberately none. BlueMap's storage is
 * incremental: `<map>/rstate/` holds `MapTileState`, `MapChunkState` and `MapRegionState`
 * as small per-region cells, and a plain `-r` re-run asks `TileActionResolver` what each
 * tile needs and renders only that. A render that got 60% of the way through a world and
 * died has 60% of the world on disk *and* the bookkeeping that says so.
 *
 * So a resume is the same render, run again, with two rules:
 *
 * 1. **Destroy nothing.** No deleting the output, no clearing `rstate`, and no `-f`.
 *    Every one of those turns a resume back into a full render, which is the exact
 *    outcome the feature exists to avoid. The orchestrator already never deletes; the
 *    request built here simply does not ask it to.
 * 2. **Same settings, or no resume.** Rendering the same map with different settings on
 *    top of tiles produced by the old ones gives a map that is half one thing and half
 *    the other, with nothing anywhere to say so. `session.ts` records a hash of the
 *    settings; a mismatch is refused, in words that name what to do about it.
 *
 * ## What counts as interrupted
 *
 * A session is written `running` and finished `completed` or `interrupted`. A session
 * still saying `running` when it is read by a *different* app instance therefore describes
 * a render whose app never got to finish the sentence: it crashed, or the machine went
 * down. That is detected on launch, written back so the file stops lying, and offered.
 *
 * It is offered, and never acted on. Silently restarting hours of rendering on somebody's
 * machine because they opened the app is not a favour, and silently discarding the record
 * throws away the only evidence that the work exists. The interface asks.
