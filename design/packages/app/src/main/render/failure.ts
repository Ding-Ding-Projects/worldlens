/**
 * Why a render did not happen, in a form the interface can act on.
 *
 * A render can fail for reasons the person is expected to fix, and every one of them
 * has a different remedy: accept the Mojang licence, install a JDK, build the jars,
 * point the map at a world that exists. A single `Error` with a sentence in it forces
 * the interface to match on prose, so the code is the contract and the message is the
 * explanation beside it.
 *
 * Every failure that a setting can fix carries the setting, because a report that says
 * what is wrong and not where to change it is a dead end at the exact moment somebody
 * knows what they want to do.
