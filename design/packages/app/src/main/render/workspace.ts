/**
 * Where a render lives on disk.
 *
 * Every render gets one directory and everything it produces stays inside it:
 *
 * ```
 * <storageDir>/<renderId>/
 *   config/            core.conf, webapp.conf, webserver.conf, maps/*.conf, storages/file.conf
 *   config-container/  the same set, written with the *container's* paths inside it
 *   data/              the Mojang client jar, extracted resources, the CLI's own log
 *   web/               settings.json and maps/<id>/... - what gets served
 *   render.json        which engine rendered this, when, and how it ended
 * ```
 *
 * The two config folders are deliberately separate rather than one folder rewritten per
 * run. `config/` names `C:\Users\me\saves\world`; `config-container/` names
 * `/worlds/overworld`, because those paths are what exist inside the container. Writing
 * both into one directory would mean a local render after a container one reading a config
 * full of Linux paths that do not exist on this machine, and reporting a missing world for
 * a world that is right there.
 *
 * The runner also uses the workspace as the child process's working directory. That is
 * belt and braces rather than redundancy: the CLI resolves relative paths against its
 * working directory, so a path this port ever failed to make absolute would land in
 * `<workspace>/` instead of wherever the app happens to have been launched from. The
 * failure mode being guarded against is not hypothetical - running the CLI from the
 * repository root once dropped 47 MB of tiles into `/web` and a 38 MB Mojang client jar
 * into `/data` at the top of the tree.
