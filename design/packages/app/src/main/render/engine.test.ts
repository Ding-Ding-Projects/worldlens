/**
 * Pinning the production default: `upstreamJavaEngine` is the `resolveEngine` the app
 * wires into local and remote rendering, and it must keep resolving to the Java engine.
 *
 * D17 keeps the Java renderer as the standing default (amended 2026-08-05, after the
 * Phase D parity gate closed): the TypeScript mesher becomes the default only through a
 * later, separately verified switch decision, not by drift. If a future change swaps
 * this resolver for one that returns `engine: "typescript"`, this test is the one that
 * has to be edited on purpose - a silent flip elsewhere in the wiring will not.
 *
 * `ensureJava` and `resolveCliJar` are mocked so the test proves what the resolver
 * *returns* without needing a real JDK or a built jar on the machine running it.
