/**
 * The render channel between the main process and the interface.
 *
 * This is the only file in `render/` that imports Electron, and the only one that
 * reads `consent.ts`. Everything else takes what it needs as a parameter, which is what
 * lets the parser, the config writer, the runner and the orchestrator be tested without
 * an Electron runtime - and, more usefully, keeps the question "does this render have
 * consent" answerable in one place instead of being re-decided in four.
 *
 * ## Why events are pushed rather than polled
 *
 * A render takes minutes. The capture this was written against went
 * `8.535% -> 88.601%` over four minutes in ten-second steps, which is exactly the shape
 * a person needs to see: a bar that moves, a percentage, and a shrinking estimate. A
 * spinner for four minutes is indistinguishable from a hang, and a hang is what people
 * conclude. So each parsed line is forwarded as it arrives.
