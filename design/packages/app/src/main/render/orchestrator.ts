/**
 * Rendering a world, from a request to a map the viewer can open.
 *
 * The order of the steps is the design. Consent is checked **first**, before a
 * workspace is created, before a JDK is looked for, before a jar is resolved and long
 * before anything is spawned, so a person who has not accepted the Mojang download
 * cannot reach a state where the app has started downloading a client jar on their
 * behalf. It also means the answer arrives instantly rather than after a JDK probe,
 * which is what makes it read as a decision rather than as a failure.
 *
 * What this deliberately does not do is ask. `consent.ts` says it plainly: the question
 * is asked once at first launch and remembered forever. Putting a licence in front of
 * somebody who has just chosen a world and pressed Render is how people learn to click
 * through consent screens without reading them. A render without consent reports what
 * is missing and points at the settings row that changes it.
 *
 * ## Two places a render can run, and one of them is the default
 *
 * {@link RenderRequest.runtime} chooses between running the engine as a program on this
 * computer and running it in a container. **Absent means local**, so every caller written
 * before the field existed - and every request stored by `session.ts` and replayed by
 * `resume.ts` - keeps exactly the behaviour it already had, with no edit anywhere.
 *
 * The local path below is unchanged: the same `writeRenderConfig`, the same `CliRun`, the
 * same arguments in the same order. It is the route with an end-to-end proof behind it,
 * and a second mode is not worth one line of risk to it.
 *
 * Everything the *interface* sees is written once and shared. Both modes emit the same
 * {@link RenderEvent}s from the same `RenderOutputTracker`, move through the same phases,
 * are classified by the same {@link classifyRunFailure}, and are stopped by the same
 * `cancel()`. That is not a promise kept by discipline; it is kept by there being no
 * second code path for progress, failure or cancellation to differ on. What differs is
 * three things and they are all here:
 *
 * ```
 * which config is written   host paths (render/config.ts) vs container paths (runtime/config.ts)
 * what is spawned           the JVM (render/runner.ts)    vs `docker run` (runtime/process.ts)
 * what a cancel asks        the child process              vs the daemon, by container name
 * ```
 *
 * ## Docker is refused, never quietly substituted
 *
 * If a container is asked for and Docker cannot take one, the render fails with the
 * reason `runtime/docker.ts` gives - which distinguishes "not installed" from "installed,
 * daemon stopped" - and nothing is spawned. Rendering locally instead would be worse than
 * the refusal: the person gets a finished map, believes they have tested the container
 * path, and finds out otherwise the first time they depend on it.
