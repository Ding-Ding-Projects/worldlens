/**
 * The record of a render that is happening, or was happening when the lights went out.
 *
 * A render of a large world takes hours. In that time the app can be closed, the machine
 * can sleep, the power can go out and a CI job can hit its ceiling. None of that may cost
 * the work already done, and almost none of it has to: **BlueMap already renders
 * incrementally**. It keeps its own bookkeeping under `<map>/rstate/` -
 * `MapTileState`, `MapChunkState` and `MapRegionState`, each a `CellStorage` of small
 * per-region cells - and a plain `-r` re-run consults `TileActionResolver` and renders
 * only what has actually changed. Everything already on disk is skipped.
 *
 * So resuming is not checkpointing. Nothing here snapshots tiles, copies state or invents
 * a format. What is missing from upstream's model is only this: **knowing that a render
 * was left unfinished**, and knowing enough about it to offer it back. A workspace on disk
 * cannot answer that on its own. `render.json` is close, and deliberately not the answer:
 * it is the provenance record, it says which engine produced these tiles, and widening it
 * into a live progress file would mean rewriting the attribution record every ten seconds
 * for the whole of a six hour render.
 *
 * This file is the other half of that pair. It is written the moment a render starts,
 * updated as it goes, and finished when it ends:
 *
 * ```
 * <storageDir>/<renderId>/
 *   render.json     which engine rendered this, and how it ended       (provenance.ts)
 *   session.json    what is running right now, and how far it got      (this file)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Two things worth being precise about
 *
 * **Crash safety.** Every write is staged and renamed, exactly as `consent.ts` does it,
 * so the file is never readable in a half-written state. That matters more here than
 * almost anywhere else: this is the file read by an app that has just come back from a
 * crash, which is precisely the moment a half-written file from *before* the crash would
 * be sitting on disk. A record that will not parse is treated as absent rather than
 * guessed at; the failure mode of guessing is offering somebody a resume of a render
 * whose settings are half read.
 *
 * **How a crash is detected at all.** Not by process id: pids are reused, and a stale one
 * that happens to match some unrelated process would make a dead render look alive
 * forever. Instead each session records the id of the **app instance** that owns it. That
 * id is fresh on every launch, and a render only lives as long as the app that spawned
 * it. So a session still marked `running` whose owner is not this instance is, by
 * construction, a render whose app is gone: the app died, or the machine did. The pid is
 * recorded too, but only as evidence for a support question, never as the test.

 * rendered bright.
 *
 * What stays out, deliberately:
 *
 * - **Render threads and metrics.** They change how fast the render goes and whether
 *   upstream is pinged. Neither changes a single byte of a tile, and refusing a resume
 *   over them would be refusing for no reason.
 * - **`-f` and `-e`.** They are arguments to a run, not settings of a map. `-f` is in
 *   fact the opposite of a resume, and a person who passes it is asking for the work to
 *   be redone.
 * - **The engine version.** Recorded in the session and reported with the offer, but not
 *   a refusal: an app update between two halves of a long render is ordinary, and
 *   refusing every resume after every update would make the feature useless. The
 *   interface has the version and can say it changed.
 *
 * Paths are resolved first, and case-folded on the platforms whose file systems are, for
 * the same reason `renderIdForWorld` does it: `C:\World` and `c:\world` are one folder,
 * and treating them as two would refuse a resume that is perfectly safe.
