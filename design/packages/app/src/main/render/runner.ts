/**
 * Running the BlueMap CLI as a child process, and stopping it.
 *
 * The CLI is spawned directly - `<java> -jar <cli.jar> -c <configDir> -r ...` - with no
 * shell in between. A shell would add a process between this one and the JVM, and the
 * cancel path would then kill the shell and leave a detached JVM rendering into
 * somebody's disk with nothing left holding a handle to it.
 *
 * ## What cancellation actually does
 *
 * Measured on this machine rather than assumed. Spawning the CLI, letting it render for
 * twenty-five seconds and calling `child.kill("SIGINT")` produced:
 *
 * ```
 * >>> sending SIGINT at 2026-08-03T16:46:40.307Z
 * >>> kill returned: true
 * >>> exit code=null signal=SIGINT at 2026-08-03T16:46:40.353Z
 * ```
 *
 * Forty-six milliseconds, and none of the CLI's shutdown sequence
 * (`Stopping...` / `Saving...` / `Stopped.`) ran. That is Windows: it has no POSIX
 * signals, so libuv implements every `kill` as `TerminateProcess` and the JVM's
 * shutdown hook never gets the chance to flush. No orphan was left behind, which is
 * what matters most - the process tree is one JVM and killing it kills the render.
 *
 * On a platform that does deliver signals, SIGINT reaches the JVM's shutdown hook and
 * the CLI saves what it has rendered before exiting, which is a genuinely better
 * cancel. So the sequence is the same on both: ask politely, wait, and escalate to
 * SIGKILL only if the process is still there. On Windows the first step already ended
 * it and the escalation never fires; on Linux and macOS the wait is what buys the tiles
 * already rendered. Either way an interrupted render loses no *finished* work, because
 * BlueMap's storage is incremental and the next render resumes from what is on disk.
