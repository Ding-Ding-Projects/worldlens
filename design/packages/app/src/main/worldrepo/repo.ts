/**
 * Keeping a Minecraft world in a git repository, so a render never has to re-zip it.
 *
 * ## The fact this whole feature rests on
 *
 * git deduplicates by content hash. A world is thousands of `.mca` region files; when a
 * world changes, only a handful of them do, and git only ever transfers the objects the
 * remote does not already have. Kept in a repository, a world updates the way the rest of
 * this project already does its own releases: incrementally, with nothing re-uploaded that
 * has not changed.
 *
 * ## Why this reuses the Pages publisher's shape, almost move for move
 *
 * `pages/hosting.ts` solved the identical structural problem for a rendered map: a git
 * directory kept outside the payload, a marker file that proves ownership before a branch
 * is ever touched, batched staging so a person watching thousands of files sees a number
 * move, a push read back from GitHub rather than assumed, and a durable stage record so an
 * interrupted publish can resume. Every one of those is reused here unchanged in spirit.
 *
 * What is different is the bounded staging chain used for a world:
 *
 * - **Every generated commit and push stays below decimal 1.5 GB.** Files are ordered by
 *   UTF-8 bytes, planned below 1.4 GB, committed as a linear chain, then measured from the
 *   exact objects each commit introduces. A candidate over either hard ceiling is refused
 *   before any data is uploaded.
 * - **The target stays atomic.** Each bounded commit advances a unique staging ref under an
 *   exact force-with-lease and is read back before the next begins. Only after every batch
 *   is verified does one final leased ref update publish the complete tree.
 * - **The repository does not grow by one permanent chain per sync.** The target is replaced
 *   with the new snapshot chain and the temporary staging ref is removed after verification;
 *   the previous snapshot becomes unreachable just as the old one-commit design intended.
 * - **Incremental transfer is still preserved.** The current target is fetched before a new
 *   root chain is built, and Git's negotiation can reuse every identical object already on
 *   the server. A failed fetch is now a refusal rather than an unbounded fallback.
 *
 * ## The marker, again
 *
 * `WORLD_REPO_MARKER_FILE` plays the same ownership role `PAGES_MARKER_FILE` does: a branch
 * that does not carry it is never replaced or deleted. It is synthesized directly into
 * Git's private index, so neither it nor the partial-upload marker is ever written into the
 * person's live world folder.
 *
 * ## Honesty this module owes the person publishing
 *
 * A live Minecraft server's world folder is being written to while a sync reads it, and a
 * region file mid-save can be caught torn - {@link WorldRepoHost.preflight} says so. GitHub
 * blocks any single file over 100 MB outright and recommends repositories stay under
 * roughly a gigabyte; both are checked and reported rather than discovered from a rejected
 * push. Worldlens additionally enforces its decimal 1.5 GB commit/pack ceiling locally. A
 * push GitHub refuses - a branch rule, a size limit, an expired sign-in - is reported with
 * GitHub's own words, never guessed at.
