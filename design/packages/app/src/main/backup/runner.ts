/**
 * Making a backup: pack, split, publish, upload, and say so as it happens.
 *
 * The twin of `download/downloader.ts`, and deliberately its mirror image. That one
 * fetches parts, verifies each one, rejoins them and unpacks; this one packs, splits,
 * hashes each part and uploads them. They meet at the Cheap LFS pointer, which is the
 * only thing either of them has to agree about, and at the fact that both push progress
 * rather than waiting to be asked - a backup of a 20 GB world is measured in hours, and a
 * spinner for an hour is indistinguishable from a hang.
 *
 * ## Order matters, and the pointer goes last
 *
 * Parts first, then the sidecar, then the pointer. The pointer is the **completion
 * marker**: a release that has one is a backup that finished, and a release that has
 * parts and no pointer is an upload that stopped part-way. A listing therefore shows only
 * the finished ones, and a resumed backup can tell the difference between "these thirty
 * parts are already there" and "this backup is done" without downloading anything.
 *
 * Doing it the other way round - pointer first, so the release looks complete while the
 * parts are still going up - would produce exactly one failure mode, and it is the worst
 * one this feature has: a backup somebody trusts, that restores as an unverifiable
 * fragment on the day they need it.
 *
 * ## Nothing that already exists is ever touched
 *
 * A backup creates a release. It does not edit one, delete one, delete an asset, or
 * replace an asset's bytes - `github.ts` has no function that could, and this file has no
 * path that would want one. A resumed upload *reads* the release it created and skips the
 * parts already on it, which is the only reason it looks at an existing release at all.
 *
 * ## Cancelling costs time, not data
 *
 * Every phase takes the abort signal, and a cancelled backup leaves the staged archive
 * and the parts where they are. Starting again with the same tag re-uses them and skips
 * the parts already uploaded, so stopping is safe at any point and the second attempt
 * carries on rather than starting over. The one thing a cancel never does is leave a
 * pointer on a release that has no parts under it.
