/**
 * The one gap `runner.test.ts`, `restore.test.ts` and the rest of this directory all name
 * and do not close: real contact with github.com. Every other test here proves the code is
 * right about GitHub's documented shapes against a recording fake; this file finds out
 * whether a real backup, a real resume, and a real restore actually work against the real
 * release API, following the same "loud skip by default, real network on request" pattern
 * `github.realAccount.test.ts` uses.
 *
 * ## What is proven here, and how
 *
 * Set **`MBM_TEST_BACKUP_LIVE=1`** and **`MBM_TEST_BACKUP_REPO`** (`owner/repo` the
 * active `gh` CLI account can push to) to run it. Authentication stays in the CLI store:
 *
 * 1. Packs a small multi-part world, publishes it as a real release with `BackupRunner`
 *    against real `api.github.com` and `uploads.github.com`, and confirms the pointer, the
 *    sidecar and every part actually landed as real release assets.
 * 2. Cancels a *second* backup of the same world mid-upload, after its first part is
 *    genuinely on the release, then resumes it under the same tag and confirms the resume
 *    reuses the *original* archive name rather than re-deriving one from the resuming
 *    call's own clock - the exact bug fixed in `archiveNameFromTag` (see `source.ts`'s own
 *    doc comment), now checked against the real release API rather than only the fake one
 *    `runner.test.ts` uses.
 * 3. Restores both releases with `BackupRestoreRunner` against the same real API and
 *    confirms the unpacked content is byte-for-byte the original folder.
 *
 * ## What this still does not prove
 *
 * That a backup made here restores through `desktop-material`'s own restore path. That
 * needs that application running against a real release, which this suite cannot do; see
 * `restore.ts`'s own doc comment and the article's callout for the precise scope of what
 * is and is not claimed about interoperability.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is cleaned up automatically
 *
 * Every release this test creates is left on the repository as durable evidence - append-
 * only, exactly as the feature promises - rather than deleted at the end of the run. A
 * repository used for this is expected to accumulate a few small prerelease tags.
