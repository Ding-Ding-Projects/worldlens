/**
 * The GitHub calls a backup makes, and the rules it will not break to make them.
 *
 * Four things happen here and nothing else: the repositories somebody can actually write
 * to are listed, one repository is read so its visibility can be stated before anything
 * leaves the machine, a **new** release is created, and assets are uploaded to it as
 * streams. Reading releases back for a listing is the fifth.
 *
 * ## Append-only, and it is enforced here rather than remembered
 *
 * Every backup is its own release under its own unique tag. Nothing in this file updates
 * a release, deletes one, deletes an asset, or replaces an asset's bytes - there is no
 * function that could. {@link createBackupRelease} refuses a tag that already exists
 * instead of adopting it, so the failure mode where a retry quietly writes over yesterday
 * 's backup is not a bug that could be introduced by a wrong argument; the call it would
 * need does not exist in this module.
 *
 * The one deliberate exception is {@link findExistingAssets}, which *reads* a release this
 * run created so an interrupted upload can skip the parts it already put there. Reading
 * is not writing, and resuming a 20 GB upload from part 31 rather than part 1 is the
 * difference between a backup that completes on a home connection and one that does not.
 *
 * ## Nothing here holds a payload in memory
 *
 * `uploadAsset` takes a path and streams the file into the request body. A part is 500
 * MiB and an archive is many of them; the whole point of the split is that nothing ever
 * has to hold one. `fetch` with a stream body needs `duplex: "half"`, which is not in the
 * DOM lib's `RequestInit`, so it is attached through a narrow cast at the one call site
 * rather than by widening the type everywhere.
 *
 * ## Authentication never comes from here
 *
 * Callers supply a request function from one main-process `gh` account lease. This module
 * neither accepts nor constructs an authorization value.

 * something is wrong with the naming, not that the release should be reused.
 *
 * ## 422 is not only a tag collision
 *
 * A live run against an empty repository - one created but never pushed to - found this
 * the hard way: GitHub answers the *same* status, 422, for "this tag already exists" and
 * for "this repository has no commits yet, so there is nothing to tag." Assuming the first
 * for every 422 (as this function used to) tells somebody backing up to a brand-new
 * repository for the first time that a release "already exists" and to "start the backup
 * again to get a fresh tag" - advice that fails identically forever, because the real
 * problem is that the repository is empty, not that a tag collided. The two are told apart
 * by GitHub's own structured `errors[].code`: `already_exists` for a real collision,
 * anything else read for what it actually says.
 *
 * The release is created as a **prerelease** and marked in its body. A repository's
 * "latest release" is what an installer link and a release feed point at, and a backup
 * quietly becoming the latest release of somebody's project would be a real nuisance
 * caused by a feature they only wanted for storage.
