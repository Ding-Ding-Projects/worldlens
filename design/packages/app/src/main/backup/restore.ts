/**
 * Restoring a backup: reading the pointer, fetching every part, rejoining, unpacking.
 *
 * The twin of `runner.ts`, and its mirror image exactly as `download/downloader.ts` is the
 * mirror of `cirender/upload.ts`. That module packs, splits and uploads; this one downloads,
 * rejoins and unpacks. They meet at the Cheap LFS pointer.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all, and is not `main/download/`
 *
 * The barrel comment in `index.ts` used to say a backup is restored by handing its release
 * to `main/download/`, "the surface that already fetches parts, verifies each one, rejoins
 * them and unpacks". That was never true. `main/download/` understands exactly one split
 * format: a `<name>.parts.json` manifest beside `<name>.001`, `<name>.002`, ... - the format
 * `@worldlens/parts` writes for CI-rendered maps and world sources. A backup's parts
 * are named `<archive>.<index>-<sha16>` by `partAssetName` in `runner.ts`, and no
 * `.parts.json` is ever published beside them - the Cheap LFS pointer is the manifest, and
 * it is a different shape on purpose, because it has to stay byte-for-byte what
 * `desktop-material`'s own parser accepts. `main/download/`'s `availableDownloads` does not
 * recognise a Cheap LFS release as a split download at all: every part shows up as its own
 * unrelated whole file, and the archive name the pointer names is not the name of any single
 * asset on the release. Handing a backup's coordinates to that surface could not have worked,
 * and nothing before this file ever exercised it against a real release to find out.
 *
 * This module is what actually restores one, by translating the pointer into a
 * `@worldlens/parts` `PartsManifest` in memory - same digests, same total, same part
 * order, just relabelled into the shape `joinParts` already knows how to verify and rejoin -
 * so the rejoin itself is not reimplemented, only pointed at translated data.
 *
 * ## Order and safety, mirrored from `runner.ts`
 *
 * A release is only a *finished* backup once its pointer is up, and this refuses to restore
 * one that is not: an upload that stopped part-way has no whole-file digest to check a
 * rejoin against, and "restore this" would mean "trust whatever arrives", which is the one
 * thing the pointer format exists to make unnecessary.
 *
 * Every part is fetched with a resumable ranged request and verified against its own
 * SHA-256 before the rejoin trusts it; the rejoin then re-verifies the whole file against
 * the pointer's own digest, exactly as a fresh Cheap LFS restore in `desktop-material` would.
 * Nothing downstream of a failed digest is unpacked.
