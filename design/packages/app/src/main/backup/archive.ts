/**
 * Packing a folder into one deterministic Zip64 archive, streamed.
 *
 * A backup has to be a single file before it can be split and uploaded, and the single
 * file has to be a **zip** rather than anything cleverer for one reason: the restore half
 * of this feature is `main/download/`, which already fetches parts, verifies each one,
 * rejoins them and unpacks the result - and the thing it unpacks is a zip, through
 * `download/zip.ts`. Inventing a second container here would mean a second extractor,
 * a second set of path-traversal defences and a second place for them to disagree.
 *
 * ## Deterministic, and what that costs
 *
 * The same folder packs to the same bytes, every time, on any machine:
 *
 * - entries are sorted by their **UTF-8 bytes**, not by a locale collation, so a machine
 *   set to Turkish does not order `I` differently from one set to English;
 * - every timestamp is the same fixed DOS stamp, because a file's mtime is not part of a
 *   world and letting it in would make two identical backups two different archives;
 * - modes, external attributes, comments and the "version made by" byte are all fixed;
 * - nothing is compressed. Everything is stored.
 *
 * That last one is the deliberate cost. A render is mostly PNG tiles and a world is
 * mostly already-compressed region files, so deflate buys single-digit percentages on the
 * bulk of the payload while spending CPU on every byte of a multi-gigabyte pack. Storing
 * also makes the pack I/O-bound and interruptible, and makes a re-pack of an unchanged
 * folder produce the identical digest, which is what lets a repeated backup be recognised
 * rather than re-uploaded. If a future version wants compression, the Cheap LFS pointer
 * already has a `part-deflate` line for it - which is a reason to leave this simple now.
 *
 * ## One pass over each file
 *
 * A zip's local header carries the CRC-32 and the sizes, which are not known until the
 * bytes have been read. The alternatives are reading every file twice - doubling the disk
 * read on a 20 GB pack - or the streaming form the format provides for exactly this: set
 * the "sizes follow" flag, write placeholders, and put the true values in a data
 * descriptor after the data and in the central directory. Every reader that matters,
 * including this project's own, reads sizes from the central directory, so the descriptor
 * costs 24 bytes an entry and saves a whole second read of the payload.
 *
 * Zip64 records are written for **every** entry rather than only for the large ones. A
 * conditional would be smaller and would mean the 4 GB boundary is a code path that only
 * runs on the archives nobody can afford to test with.
