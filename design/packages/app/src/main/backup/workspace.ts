/**
 * Where a backup is staged on disk while it is being made.
 *
 * The same shape `render/workspace.ts` and `download/workspace.ts` use, for the same
 * reason: one directory per backup, everything it produces inside it, so an abandoned or
 * failed attempt is one folder somebody can delete rather than a scatter of `.001` files
 * through the storage directory.
 *
 * ```
 * <storageDir>/backups/<backupId>/
 *   <archive>.zip           the packed folder, written once and hashed as it is written
 *   parts/                  the .001, .002, ... and the parts manifest, ready to upload
 *   backup.json             the sidecar, uploaded beside the pointer
 *   <archive>.zip.cheaplfs  the Cheap LFS pointer, uploaded last
 * ```
 *
 * ## The archive is deleted after a successful upload, and the pointer is not
 *
 * The archive is the big thing: a copy of a folder that is still on the disk beside it,
 * so keeping it doubles what the backup costs in space at exactly the moment somebody was
 * trying to make space. Once every part is on the release and verified, the local copy is
 * the redundant one and it goes.
 *
 * What stays is the pointer and the sidecar, a couple of kilobytes together. They are how
 * a person finds their backup again without asking GitHub - which matters most in the
 * situation a backup exists for, when the thing that broke might be the network.
