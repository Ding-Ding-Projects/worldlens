/**
 * Reading a GitHub release, and working out what is actually downloadable from it.
 *
 * A release asset is capped at 2 GB, so a large world ships as `world.zip.001`,
 * `world.zip.002`, ... beside a `world.zip.parts.json`. To a person looking at the
 * release page that is twenty files; to this module it is one download called
 * `world.zip` that happens to arrive in twenty pieces. Everything downstream works with
 * that single name, which is why the split is invisible in the interface.
 *
 * ## Authentication
 *
 * A public release needs no sign-in and must never demand one. Private repository requests
 * are performed by the main-process gh account lease; authorization stays inside gh.
 *
 * When there is no gh lease the `browser_download_url` is used instead, which redirects to
 * a CDN and is not subject to the unauthenticated API's sixty-requests-an-hour limit. A
 * twenty-part world would spend a third of that limit on one download.
