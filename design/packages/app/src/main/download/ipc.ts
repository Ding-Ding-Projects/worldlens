/**
 * The download channel between the main process and the interface.
 *
 * The twin of `render/ipc.ts`, deliberately built to the same shape: this is the only
 * file under `download/` that imports Electron, everything else takes what it needs as a
 * parameter, and every progress event is **pushed** rather than polled.
 *
 * The pushing is not a style choice. A twenty-gigabyte world is a download measured in
 * tens of minutes, and the capture the render bar was written against makes the point:
 * a bar that moves, a percentage and a shrinking estimate read as work in progress,
 * while a spinner for the same duration reads as a hang. People conclude a hang and
 * quit the application, which on a resumable download costs them nothing but the belief
 * that it worked.
