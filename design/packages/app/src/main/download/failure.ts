/**
 * Why a download did not finish, in a form the interface can act on.
 *
 * The same contract `render/failure.ts` states, for the same reason: a download can fail
 * for reasons a person is expected to fix, and every one of them has a different remedy.
 * A single `Error` with a sentence in it forces the interface to match on prose, so the
 * code is the contract and the message is the explanation beside it.
 *
 * `SettingsTarget` is reused rather than restated. A download that cannot write is a
 * download whose storage folder is wrong, and that is the same setting and the same row
 * a render sends somebody to.
