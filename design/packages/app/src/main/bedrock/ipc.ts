/**
 * The Bedrock-conversion channel between the main process and the interface.
 *
 * Built to the same shape as `world/index.ts` and `java/ipc.ts`: this is the only file
 * under `bedrock/` that names Electron at all, it names it only as a *type*, `IpcMain`
 * arrives as a parameter, and every channel is listed once in {@link BEDROCK_CHANNELS} so
 * `dispose` cannot drift from the registration. The import is erased at build time, so the
 * whole directory runs and is tested without an Electron runtime.
 *
 * Broadcasting is a parameter too, rather than reaching for `BrowserWindow` here. A
 * conversion is a long push-based operation like a render, but the thing that knows which
 * windows exist is the caller, and taking it as a function is what keeps this file free of
 * an Electron value import.
 *
 * ## No handler rejects
 *
 * Every one of these returns a value, including every refusal. "Chunker is not installed",
 * "that folder is a Java world", "the conversion failed" and "the argument was not a
 * string" are all ordinary things for this screen to display, and a rejected `invoke`
 * arrives in the renderer as an `Error` whose message has been mangled by Electron's
 * serialisation - which turns a sentence somebody could act on into a stack trace they
 * cannot. The one thing a caller never has to write here is a try/catch.
 *
 * ## A conversion is started explicitly, and only ever by a person
 *
 * Nothing in this module converts anything as a side effect of looking at a folder.
 * `bedrock:detect` reads and reports; `bedrock:convert` is the only thing that writes, it
 * needs a folder chosen by hand, and the interface is expected to have shown the fidelity
 * briefing, the destination and the size estimate first. Producing a second multi-gigabyte
 * copy of somebody's world is not something that should ever happen because a screen was
 * opened.
