/**
 * The one thing `ipc.test.ts` cannot prove: that `registerBedrockHandlers` is actually
 * called somewhere real.
 *
 * Every handler in `ipc.ts` is fully exercised in isolation against a fake `IpcMain`, and
 * that suite would stay green even if `registerBedrockHandlers` were never invoked outside
 * a test file - which is exactly what happened. `main/index.ts` imports and calls every
 * other subsystem's `register*`/`install*` entry point from `registerIpc()` /
 * `createWindow()`, but never called this one, so the whole Bedrock conversion feature had
 * no reachable entry point: no IPC channel was ever registered on a running app, and the
 * renderer had no way to reach it.
 *
 * `main/index.ts` cannot be imported directly here without mocking most of Electron and
 * every subsystem it wires - it calls `app.whenReady()` as a side effect of module load.
 * So this reads the real, live source the same way `menuCoverage.test.ts` reads the real
 * `.vue` files: a static check that the wiring genuinely exists, not a claim about it.
