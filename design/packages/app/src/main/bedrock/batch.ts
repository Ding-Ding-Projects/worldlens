/**
 * Converting a large world in pieces, one JVM at a time, without producing seams.
 *
 * Chunker's memory use grows without bound on larger worlds (see `memory.ts`), so a world
 * past the threshold is unlikely to convert in one pass. Batching bounds the problem from
 * both directions at once, and it does so whichever account of the memory behaviour is
 * correct: if it is a leak, a fresh JVM per batch reclaims everything on exit; if the world
 * is simply too large for the available RAM, a smaller slice needs less. Either way the
 * failure is bounded by the batch rather than by the whole world, and a batch that fails can
 * be retried without losing the batches that succeeded.
 *
 * Everything below was established by reading Chunker's source rather than by guessing, and
 * the four facts that make this possible at all are worth stating plainly.
 *
 * ## 1. The CLI really can convert a subset
 *
 * `-p` / `--pruning` takes `{"configs": {"<dimension>": {"include": true, "regions": [...]}}}`
 * where each region is a chunk bounding box - `minChunkX`, `minChunkZ`, `maxChunkX`,
 * `maxChunkZ` (`com.hivemc.chunker.pruning.PruningRegion`). `include: true` keeps what is
 * inside the boxes and discards everything else, and several boxes union together.
 *
 * ## 2. Pruning skips reading, so it genuinely bounds memory
 *
 * This is the part that would have made the whole idea pointless if it were the other way
 * round. In `BedrockWorldReader`, `shouldProcessRegion` gates a whole region before any task
 * is scheduled for it, and `shouldProcessColumn` is checked *before* `createColumnReader`:
 *
 * ```java
 * for (ChunkCoordPair chunkCoordPair : region.getValue()) {
 *     if (!converter.shouldProcessColumn(dimension, chunkCoordPair)) continue;
 *     Task.async("Creating Column Reader", ..., () -> createColumnReader(chunkCoordPair))
 * ```
 *
 * An excluded chunk is never read, never decoded and never held. Pruning is not a filter
 * applied to a fully converted world.
 *
 * ## 3. A naive batcher WOULD produce subtly broken worlds - this is the trap
 *
 * Chunker infers block states from neighbouring columns after reading
 * (`ColumnPreTransformConversionHandler`): fences, walls, panes, bars, tripwire, redstone,
 * stems, double chests, doors and stair shapes all have their connection state decided by
 * what is in the adjacent column. When a required neighbour never arrives, the final
 * `flushColumns()` transforms the column anyway, and `handlePreTransform` drops the
 * unresolved edges:
 *
 * ```java
 * // Remove null values and map them back to column, null values are just unresolved edges
 * requiredColumns.forEach(((edge, columnData) -> { if (columnData == null) return; ... }));
 * ```
 *
 * So a column at the edge of a pruned area is converted **as though the neighbouring chunk
 * were empty**. Nothing hangs and nothing is dropped - the world converts cleanly and is
 * quietly wrong along every batch boundary, which is exactly the failure that is worse than
 * refusing, because a fence that renders unconnected looks like a fence somebody built that
 * way.
 *
 * ## 4. The fix: convert with a margin, keep only what the margin protected
 *
 * Each batch is a set of whole 32x32 **regions**, and its pruning boxes are those regions
 * grown by {@link MARGIN_CHUNKS} chunk on every side. Every chunk of every region the batch
 * *owns* therefore has all of its neighbours loaded, so its connection states are decided
 * with complete information. The extra margin chunks spill into neighbouring regions, whose
 * output files are consequently partial - so after the batch runs, only the region files it
 * owns are kept and the partial ones are discarded.
 *
 * One chunk is enough, and that is a property of the handlers rather than an assumption: a
 * pre-transform reads its *immediate* neighbour columns' blocks. The transitive clustering
 * in `trySolve` decides when columns can be processed together, not how far a block's
 * connection query reaches.
 *
 * Because the unit is a whole region file and every region is produced by exactly one batch,
 * merging is a file copy. Nothing here ever has to splice chunks inside an Anvil file, which
 * is the one operation that would put the format's sector allocation at risk.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not slice the *input*. A Bedrock world is one LevelDB database whose keys interleave
 * every dimension and chunk; cutting it up outside Chunker would mean writing a LevelDB
 * editor and would risk corrupting the original, which is the one thing this feature promises
 * never to touch. All slicing is expressed to Chunker as pruning, and the original is only
 * ever opened for reading.
