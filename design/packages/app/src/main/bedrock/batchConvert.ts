/**
 * Running a batched conversion: one JVM per batch, in sequence, merged as it goes.
 *
 * `batch.ts` decides *what* the batches are and why that is correct. This file runs them,
 * and its whole job is that the disk is never left in a state that lies:
 *
 * ```
 * <output>.converting/            the staging root - the name says "unfinished"
 *   world/                        the merged Java world, built up batch by batch
 *   batches.json                  which batches are already merged in
 *   batch-<n>/                    one batch's raw output, deleted once merged
 * <output>                        appears only at the very end, by rename
 * ```
 *
 * ## One JVM at a time, and never two
 *
 * Sequential is not a simplification, it is the entire mechanism. A fresh JVM per batch is
 * what reclaims the memory, and running two at once would put both peaks on the machine
 * simultaneously and undo the thing batching exists to do. Each batch's process is fully
 * exited - `start()` has resolved - before the next is spawned.
 *
 * ## Resuming
 *
 * A batch that has been merged is recorded in `batches.json` before the next one starts, so a
 * conversion interrupted by a failure, a cancellation or a closed app resumes from the first
 * unmerged batch rather than redoing hours of work. The ledger also records the plan it was
 * built from: if the world or the batch size has changed since, the completed set is not
 * transferable and everything starts again rather than merging pieces of two different plans
 * into one world.
 *
 * ## Why the merge is a file copy
 *
 * Every region file is produced by exactly one batch, complete, because the batch read a
 * one-chunk margin around everything it owns. So merging never opens an Anvil file, never
 * touches its sector allocation, and cannot corrupt one. The margin spill - real chunks
 * belonging to regions this batch does not own - is discarded with the rest of the batch
 * directory.
