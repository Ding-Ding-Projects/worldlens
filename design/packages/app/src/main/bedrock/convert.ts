/**
 * Running Chunker over a Bedrock world, and refusing to leave anything that looks like
 * a world unless one was actually produced.
 *
 * The invocation is the one Chunker's own README documents:
 *
 * ```
 * <java> -jar chunker-cli-<version>.jar -i <bedrock world> -f JAVA_1_21_4 -o <output>
 * ```
 *
 * Spawned directly, with no shell in between, for the same reason `render/runner.ts`
 * does it: a shell between this process and the JVM means the cancel path kills the shell
 * and leaves a detached JVM writing gigabytes into somebody's disk with nothing holding a
 * handle to it.
 *
 * ## Exit code zero does not mean it worked
 *
 * This is the single most important fact about driving this CLI, it is not obvious, and
 * it was established by reading Chunker's `CLI.java` rather than by guessing. Three of its
 * failure paths print a message to stderr and then leave `run()` normally, so picocli
 * returns 0 and the process exits 0:
 *
 * - `Failed to find suitable reader for the world.` - the input was not a world Chunker
 *   recognises. This is the *most likely* failure in this app, because it is what a
 *   corrupt or half-copied Bedrock world produces.
 * - `Failed to find suitable writer for the world.` - the target format was rejected.
 * - the `--keepOriginalNBT` guard, which calls `System.exit(0)` explicitly on refusal.
 *
 * A caller that trusts the exit code therefore reports a triumphant success over an empty
 * directory. So success here requires all three of: exit code 0, the `Conversion complete!`
 * line on stdout, and an output directory that {@link verifyConvertedWorld} confirms holds
 * an actual Java world. Any one of them missing is a failure, and is reported as one.
 *
 * The codes that *are* meaningful: `1` is a conversion exception, `12` is
 * `OutOfMemoryError`, and `2` is picocli's usage error, which for this app means it built a
 * command line wrong.
 *
 * ## Running out of memory is the expected failure, and exit code 12 rarely catches it
 *
 * Chunker's memory use grows without bound on larger worlds (see `memory.ts` for the
 * observation and who is claiming it), so out-of-memory is not an exotic case here - on a
 * big world it is the *likely* ending, and it deserves its own sentence rather than being
 * folded into a generic "conversion failed".
 *
 * Exit code 12 is not a reliable way to spot it. Chunker's `catch (OutOfMemoryError)` wraps
 * the body of `run()`, which is the **main** thread; the conversion itself runs as a task,
 * and a failure on one of its worker threads is captured by `conversionTask.future()
 * .exceptionally(...)`, printed as `Failed with exception` plus a stack trace, and exited
 * with **code 1**. So the most likely out-of-memory death arrives looking exactly like any
 * other exception, and a classifier keyed on exit 12 alone would mislabel it.
 *
 * Three signals are therefore treated as out-of-memory, in this order of reliability:
 * an `OutOfMemoryError`-shaped line anywhere in the output (which covers both the main
 * thread and every worker thread, and the `-XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError` termination
 * notice), exit code 12, and - only when nothing completed - a process killed outright with
 * no exit code at all, which is what the operating system's own out-of-memory killer leaves
 * behind on a machine driven into paging.
 *
 * ## Nothing is written where a world would be until it is a world
 *
 * The conversion writes into a sibling staging directory ending in {@link STAGING_SUFFIX},
 * and that directory is renamed to the real name only after the output has been verified.
 * A cancelled conversion, a crashed JVM, a full disk and a machine that lost power all
 * leave a directory whose name says plainly that it is unfinished, and which the next run
 * removes. The alternative - converting in place and cleaning up afterwards - relies on
 * the cleanup code getting to run, which is exactly what does not happen in the cases that
 * matter.
 *
 * ## Cancellation
 *
 * Chunker's CLI polls a progress value in a loop and has no interrupt path of its own, so
 * cancelling means ending the process. As `render/runner.ts` documents from measurement on
 * this platform, Windows has no POSIX signals and libuv implements every `kill` as
 * `TerminateProcess`, so the JVM dies immediately without running a shutdown hook. There
 * is nothing to flush and nothing to lose: a half-written Java world is worthless, which
 * is precisely why it is being written under a staging name and deleted rather than saved.

 * The JVM arguments to run Chunker with, and - just as deliberately - the one that is absent.

 * **No `-Xmx`.** Chunker's memory use grows without bound on larger worlds (see
 * `memory.ts`), and against unbounded growth a heap ceiling is not a fix, it is the point at
 * which the failure happens. Raising it does not avoid the failure; it delays it, and a
 * delayed one lands harder, because a JVM permitted to reach most of physical memory drives
 * the machine into paging or gets killed by the operating system - which reaches this code
 * as a process that vanished rather than as an `OutOfMemoryError` anybody can read. Leaving
 * it off means the JVM's own default ceiling applies, which is a documented, predictable
 * fraction of physical RAM and is not a claim by this app that the problem is handled.
 *
 * **`-XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError`** is the one flag genuinely worth passing, and it is not a
 * mitigation either - it changes nothing about whether the conversion succeeds. It makes the
 * *failure* honest: the JVM halts at the first `OutOfMemoryError` on any thread and prints
 * `Terminating due to java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`. Without it, Chunker catches a
 * worker-thread failure into `exceptionally(...)` and exits 1 like any other exception,
 * while the process may thrash for minutes first. With it the ending is immediate and
 * carries a line {@link OUT_OF_MEMORY_LINE} recognises, which is what lets the person be
