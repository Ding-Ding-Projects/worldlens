/**
 * Finding a Chunker CLI to run, and fetching one only when it can be checked.
 *
 * Chunker is Hive Games' open-source converter between Minecraft's two editions
 * (https://github.com/HiveGamesOSS/Chunker, MIT). Every release publishes a standalone
 * `chunker-cli-<version>.jar` - around 30 MB, no installer, no native parts - which is
 * exactly the shape this app can use, because it already knows how to run a jar on a
 * verified JVM.
 *
 * ## What "verify what it downloads" can honestly mean here
 *
 * This was researched rather than assumed, and the answer is narrower than one would
 * like. As of Chunker 1.19.1:
 *
 * - There is **no** `SHA256SUMS` file, and **no** detached signature (`.asc`, `.sig`,
 *   `.intoto.jsonl`) among the release assets.
 * - There is **no** GitHub artifact attestation for the CLI jar.
 * - Hive Games *does* Authenticode-sign their Windows artifacts with Azure Trusted
 *   Signing, but that covers the Electron desktop application's `.exe` files. The CLI jar
 *   is not an `.exe` and carries no such signature.
 * - What does exist is GitHub's own per-asset `digest` field on the releases API, a
 *   `sha256:` hash GitHub computes over the asset it is storing.
 *
 * So the strongest available check is a SHA-256, and it is **GitHub's statement about the
 * bytes it holds, not Hive Games' signature over the bytes they built**. That distinction
 * is real and is not smoothed over: it means the digest and the download share a single
 * root of trust, and a fetch of both in one session proves the file arrived intact, not
 * that it is the artefact its publisher intended.
 *
 * Two things follow, and both are deliberate:
 *
 * 1. **A digest is pinned in this source file** ({@link PINNED_CHUNKER}), reviewed and
 *    committed like any other code. When the pinned release is the one being fetched,
 *    the check is against a constant that a compromised API cannot move.
 * 2. **Resolving a newer release from the API is allowed but downgraded.** The result
 *    carries {@link ChunkerRelease.digestTrust} saying which of the two happened, and the
 *    interface is expected to say so rather than showing an identical green tick for a
 *    materially weaker guarantee.
 *
 * Nothing here ever installs an unverified file: {@link downloadVerified} renames a
 * `.part` file into place only after the hash matches, so a file at the final path is
 * always one that passed.
 *
 * ## Licence, and why the jar now ships inside the installer
 *
 * Chunker is MIT (Copyright (c) 2024 Hive Games), which permits redistribution and so
 * permits bundling the jar, provided the copyright notice and the licence text ship with it.
 *
 * This block used to say the app "nevertheless does not bundle it", on the grounds that
 * 30 MB in every installer for a feature most people never use was a poor trade and that a
 * bundled copy pins a converter version to an app release. The first half was re-decided:
 * an installer that cannot convert a world until the machine has been online is not an
 * installer that contains the app, and "download this first" is a defect however politely it
 * is worded. The second half is simply true, and is now a real consequence rather than a
 * hypothetical one: the converter version moves when the app version moves, or when someone
 * points `CHUNKER_CLI_JAR` at their own copy.
 *
 * `scripts/stage-bundled-runtimes.mjs` stages the jar into the installer using this exact
 * asset and this exact digest, so a bundled install and a downloaded one are the same
 * converter rather than two things that merely share a version number. Everything below
 * stays: it is the fallback for a build with nothing staged, and it is what keeps the
 * download path honest when one is needed.
