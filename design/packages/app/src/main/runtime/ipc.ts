/**
 * The runtime channel between the main process and the settings screen.
 *
 * Built like `java/ipc.ts` and `config/ipc.ts`: Electron arrives as a *type*, `IpcMain` is
 * a parameter, and the import is erased at build time, so this module and everything it
 * calls is exercised without an Electron runtime. Every channel is named once in
 * {@link RUNTIME_CHANNELS} so `dispose` cannot drift from the registration.
 *
 * **No handler here rejects.** The question these channels answer is "can I run this in a
 * container?", and every possible answer - including "Docker exploded" - is a sentence the
 * settings row has to show. A rejection would arrive at the renderer as a bare `Error`
 * with a stack in it, and the row would have to guess what to say.
 *
 * What crosses is a fresh plain object built here field by field. Nothing that came out
 * of a subprocess is forwarded by reference, and Docker's own words travel in one clearly
 * named `detail` field rather than being spliced into the sentence.
 *
 * ## The container channels answer questions; they never carry progress
 *
 * `runtime:containers` and `runtime:reattach` are how a person is offered a render that was
 * left running in a container and how they accept. Once accepted, the render reports on the
 * **render** channel, exactly as a local or remote one does - same list, same bar, same
 * cancel button. That is why nothing here broadcasts: a second event channel would mean a
 * second list, and a render in one of them would be a render the other could neither show
 * nor stop.
