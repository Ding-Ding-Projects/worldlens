/**
 * The note a render leaves behind so a container can be found again after the app dies.
 *
 * ## Why a container needs one at all, when a local render does not
 *
 * `render/session.ts` records a local render so that a *crash* can be detected and the
 * work offered back. A containerised render has the opposite problem. The JVM is not this
 * app's child at all: `docker run` is a client attached to a container the **daemon**
 * owns, and closing the app closes the client. The render carries on. Tiles keep landing
 * in the bind-mounted output folder, the progress lines keep being written to a log
 * nobody is reading, and when the app comes back it has no idea any of it is happening.
 *
 * What is missing is never the work - the work is fine, it is still running - it is the
 * **name**. A container this app started has a name this app chose (`containerName` in
 * `plan.ts`), and knowing that name is the whole difference between reattaching to a
 * render and starting a six-hour one again beside it. This file is where the name is
 * written down, beside the render it belongs to:
 *
 * ```
 * <storageDir>/<renderId>/
 *   render.json      which engine rendered this, and how it ended     (render/provenance.ts)
 *   session.json     what is running right now, and how far it got    (render/session.ts)
 *   container.json   which container is doing it, and where           (this file)
 * ```
 *
 * ## What is in it, and why each field is
 *
 * Enough to find the container, read it, stop it, and know where its output goes -
 * nothing else. The record is written once when the container is started and removed when
 * it ends, so it is never a second copy of the progress that `session.json` already owns.
 * A record and a session that disagreed about how far a render had got would be a bug
 * with no obvious right answer, so there is only ever one of them.
 *
 * The remote half carries the target's own fields rather than a settings key. A record
 * that only named a target id would be unreadable the moment somebody renamed or deleted
 * that target, which is exactly the situation - an app that has been closed and reopened,
 * possibly for days - the record exists to survive.
 *
 * ## Detecting a container this app has lost, and why `ownerInstance` is still the test
 *
 * For the same reason `render/session.ts` gives: not a process id, which is reused, and
 * here not even the container's own existence, because a container that exists may
 * perfectly well be one *this* app instance is watching right now. Each record names the
 * app instance that owns it, fresh on every launch, so a record owned by any other value
 * describes a container whose app is gone. Whether the container is still there is then a
 * separate question, and it is asked of the daemon rather than guessed at; see `attach.ts`.
