/**
 * Whether Docker is here, and whether it will actually do anything.
 *
 * These are two questions and the whole reason this file exists is that they get
 * answered as one. "Docker is not available" is the sentence a person reads after
 * installing Docker Desktop and not starting it, and it sends them to download an
 * installer for software they already have. So the states below are distinct, each
 * carries its own sentence, and the sentence names the next thing to do:
 *
 * ```
 * not-installed        there is no `docker` command on this account's PATH
 * daemon-unreachable   the command is there; the engine behind it is not running
 * refused              the daemon is there; this account may not talk to it
 * unusable             it ran and said something this app does not recognise
 * available            a container can be started right now
 * ```
 *
 * The probe is `docker version --format {{json .}}`, which is the one command that
 * answers both halves at once: the client section comes from the binary and the server
 * section comes from the daemon. With the daemon down, Docker prints the client half to
 * stdout, an explanation to stderr, and exits non-zero - so a client version is reported
 * even in the failure states, which is what lets the settings screen say "Docker 27.4.0
 * is installed but its daemon is not running" rather than a bare negative.
