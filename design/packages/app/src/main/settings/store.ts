/**
 * The main-process copy of the application's own preferences.
 *
 * The interface keeps its preferences scattered across a dozen `localStorage` keys today -
 * `appearanceStore.ts`, `dockPlacement.ts`, `palettePrefs.ts`, `menuPrefs.ts`,
 * `setupPrefs.ts`, `tabStorage.ts`, `eulaStorage.ts`, `remoteTargets.ts` and more, one file
 * per settings surface - because each was built where it was needed and none of them had
 * anywhere in the main process to be kept instead. This module is that place: one JSON file,
 * beside the application's own data, that the version history can snapshot.
 *
 * It deliberately does not know what any individual setting means. A `values` bag keyed by
 * whatever the caller wants to call a setting, rather than a typed field per preference,
 * because typing every one of them here would make this file the thing every settings
 * surface has to agree with before it can save anything - and there are, today, more
 * settings surfaces than there is time to migrate them all in one pass. `docs/config-history.md`
 * says plainly which ones this build actually wires through here and which are still
 * `localStorage`-only.
 *
 * Reading is tolerant, writing is not - the same split `profiles/store.ts` makes, for the
 * same reason: a file this application maintains for itself should not refuse to start
 * because of a stray character in it, but a caller sending malformed input right now is a bug
 * the boundary in `ipc.ts` should refuse rather than silently coerce.
