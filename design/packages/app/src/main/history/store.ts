/**
 * Where a project's history lives, and how a config folder is matched to it.
 *
 * ## The repository is never inside the user's folder
 *
 * This is the rule the whole module is arranged around, and it is worth stating why,
 * because "put a `.git` in it, that is what git is for" is the obvious design and it is
 * wrong here.
 *
 * A BlueMap config folder belongs to the person, not to this editor. It very often already
 * sits inside something of theirs - a server directory that is itself a git repository, a
 * synchronised folder, a directory their own tooling walks. Creating a `.git` inside it
 * changes what every one of those sees: their `git status` starts reporting a nested
 * repository, their backup tool starts copying an object store, their deployment script
 * starts skipping a directory it now reads as a submodule. None of that was asked for, and
 * an editor that quietly does it has reached outside the thing it was given.
 *
 * So the history is a **separate repository beside the application's own data**, holding a
 * mirror of the config files. Nothing at all is written into the folder the user chose,
 * except by an explicit restore, which writes config files and only config files.
 *
 * ```
 * <userData>/config-history/
 *   projects.json                 the folder -> repository mapping
 *   <slug>-<hash>/                one repository per project
 *     .git/
 *     core.conf                   a mirror, not the user's file
 *     maps/overworld.conf
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why the identifier is derived and also recorded
 *
 * {@link projectId} is a pure function of the folder path, so a project finds its own
 * history again even if `projects.json` is lost, corrupted, or restored from a backup that
 * predates it. The file is still written, because the derived id is one-way: without it
 * there is no way to list what histories exist or to show the user which folder a
 * repository belongs to, and a directory of unlabelled hashes is not something anybody can
 * clean up safely.
 *
 * Paths are compared case-insensitively on Windows, where `C:\Maps` and `c:\maps` are the
 * same directory and hashing them separately would silently start a second history halfway
 * through somebody's work.
