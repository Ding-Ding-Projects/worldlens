/**
 * How much memory the render JVM is allowed to take, as a setting somebody chose.
 *
 * `render/orchestrator.ts` has always forwarded `jvmArgs` to `render/runner.ts`, which
 * places them before `-jar` exactly where a JVM wants them - and nothing has ever passed
 * any. The only caller was a unit test asserting `-Xmx4G` reached the argument list. So the
 * plumbing shipped, the setting did not, and every render this app has ever run used
 * whatever heap the JVM picked for itself.
 *
 * That default is a quarter of physical memory on most machines, and BlueMap will use all
 * of it: a render of a large world with an unbounded heap is the classic "my whole computer
 * froze" report, because the JVM takes the memory, the operating system starts swapping,
 * and every other application on the machine stops responding while a background render
 * finishes. A ceiling is what turns that into a render that is merely slower.
 *
 * ## `-Xmx`, not `-XX:MaxRAM`
 *
 * They are not the same control and picking the wrong one produces a setting that does
 * nothing. `-XX:MaxRAM` tells the JVM how much memory to *pretend* the machine has when it
 * derives its own ergonomic defaults; the heap it then chooses is a fraction of that, and
 * it may still grow past it under pressure. `-Xmx` is the hard ceiling: the heap never
 * exceeds it, and a render that needs more fails with an `OutOfMemoryError` rather than
 * taking the machine down with it. A failed render somebody can retry with a bigger number
 * is a far better outcome than a frozen desktop.
 *
 * ## Where this file lives
 *
 * Beside the path resolution rather than inside `render/`, because it is a small persisted
 * settings file this application owns on disk - the same category as everything else in
 * this directory - and because `render/` is written to be driven by its caller rather than
 * to read settings of its own.
