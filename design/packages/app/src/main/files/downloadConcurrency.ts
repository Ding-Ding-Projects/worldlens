/**
 * How many release-asset parts a download fetches at once, remembered per installation.
 *
 * `download/downloader.ts` has always accepted a `concurrency` option and honoured it
 * correctly inside `fetchParts` - the plumbing was never the problem. What was missing is
 * that the option was a plain number, captured once in `download/ipc.ts` when
 * `installDownloadIpc` was called at app launch, so nothing could ever change it short of
 * restarting the application. A settings-exposure audit flagged exactly that: a genuine
 * "how many parallel workers" decision - it trades download speed against bandwidth and
 * disk contention - sitting behind a control that would not have worked if it had been
 * built, because the value it would have written was never read again.
 *
 * This file is the other half: a persisted, bounded choice, read fresh on every download
 * the same way `renderMemory.ts`'s ceiling is read fresh on every render. See
 * `downloader.ts`'s own `ReleaseDownloaderOptions.concurrency`, which now accepts a
 * function for exactly this reason.
 *
 * ## Where the bounds come from
 *
 * Not the release format and not a shared package's default - there is no such package
 * here, unlike the part-size settings this audit also looked at and did not turn into
 * controls (see `docs/backup.md` and `cirender/sync.ts` for why not). This is a plain
 * "how many things happen at once" knob, so the bounds are worked out from what actually
 * happens on either side of it:
 *
 *  - **One** is always a safe floor: a fully sequential download, the same shape a
 *    resumed transfer already falls back to when everything but the part in flight is
 *    still on disk. Nothing below it is meaningful - zero workers download nothing.
 *  - **Sixteen** is the ceiling. A rendered world is rarely more than a handful of parts
 *    even at the small end of the part-size range (`@worldlens/parts`' own
 *    `MIN_PART_SIZE` is 100 MB, so even a modest multi-gigabyte world is a few dozen parts
 *    at most), so a number far past that buys nothing: the workers past the part count are
 *    already unused by `Math.min(concurrency, queue.length)` in `fetchParts`. What a very
 *    high number *does* do is open that many sockets against the same host at once and
 *    write that many files to the same disk at once, competing for the one connection and
 *    the one disk a typical desktop actually has, which is the "disk contention" half of
 *    the trade-off this setting exists to let somebody make on purpose rather than by
 *    accident.
 *
 * ## The default stays where it has always been
 *
 * Four, unchanged, so an existing installation's downloads do not silently get faster or
 * slower the day this setting ships - the same reasoning `PartSizeStore` used to state for
 * a setting that never actually shipped anywhere.
