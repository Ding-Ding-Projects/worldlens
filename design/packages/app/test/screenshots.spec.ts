/**
 * Screenshot harness.
 *
 * Captures the real built app through Playwright's Electron driver, so every image is the
 * actual shipped artifact rather than a mockup, a design file, or a hand-edited picture.
 * This is the only sanctioned way to produce a capture for an issue comment or a release:
 * if a surface cannot be captured here, the honest report is that it has no capture yet.
 *
 * Runs in CI under xvfb. Output lands in `screenshots/` and is uploaded as a build
 * artifact.
 *
 * ## The map is local, and the harness cannot reach the internet
 *
 * The capture used to open the app's default profile, which pointed at the public BlueMap
 * demo somebody else maintains, and pulled real tiles off it on every push (issue #17).
 * It now serves its own map over loopback - a world `packages/worldgen` generated and
 * upstream's BlueMap engine rendered, both in the same CI run - and a network guard
 * refuses and records anything that is not loopback, so the old behaviour cannot come
 * back by accident. See `captureTarget.ts` and `networkGuard.ts`.
 *
 * ## Every capture is captioned
 *
 * Each image gets a `<name>.caption.txt` beside it, an entry in `manifest.json`, and a
 * row in `captions.md` that is ready to paste into an issue comment. The caption names
 * what rendered the map, because a screenshot of a rendered world otherwise reads as
 * proof that this project renders worlds, and today it proves the viewer port.
 *
 * Every capture records the window size and display scale in its filename, so a reviewer
 * can tell at a glance which configuration a defect appears in.
 *
 * ## Every surface, or an honest note saying why not
 *
 * The set used to be the shell at four window sizes, four display scales and two colour
 * schemes: ten pictures of the same screen. A reader could not see the settings drawer,
 * the options editor, the wizard or a single dialog, so the documentation described
 * surfaces nobody outside the repository had ever seen.
 *
 * So the harness now opens each of them and photographs it. Two rules keep that honest:
 *
 *   1. **Nothing is staged.** Every surface is opened by driving the real application:
 *      real clicks, real files on disk, the app's own state. No value is planted to make
 *      a screen look populated, and no screen stands in for a different one.
 *   2. **What cannot be reached is recorded, not substituted.** A surface that genuinely
 *      needs a signed-in account, live network traffic or a running render is listed in
 *      `manifest.json` under `skipped`, with the reason. An empty `skipped` is the claim
 *      that everything was captured; a filled one is the claim that it was not.
 *
 * The surfaces are enumerated from the running application rather than from a list kept
 * here - the settings sections from their own `data-anchor` attributes, the options
 * editor's tabs from its tab strip, the wizard's steps from the step each one lands on.
 * A section added in `packages/ui` therefore arrives in this set on its own, instead of
 * being silently missing until somebody notices.
 *
 * ## Three things to know before adding a capture
 *
 * **Do not select a button by its accessible name.** Vuetify upper-cases button labels in
 * CSS, and an accessible name is computed after `text-transform`, so `getByRole("button",
 * { name: "Next" })` matches nothing while the button plainly reads Next. It fails as a
 * thirty-second timeout rather than as a not-found, which reads like a hang. Use
 * `locator(selector, { hasText })`, which matches the text in the DOM, or a class.
 *
 * **A failing test costs the whole manifest.** Playwright discards the worker after a
 * failure and starts a new one, which re-runs `beforeAll` and empties the list of
 * captures this file has accumulated - so the run ends by publishing a manifest that
 * describes only whatever happened after the failure. Every surface is therefore opened
 * inside `attempt`, which records a gap instead of throwing.
 *
 * **`.mb-eula` is not a unique selector, and a bare wait on it hangs forever.**
 * `EulaViewer.vue` is mounted in two places at once once first-run reaches its licence
 * step: the standalone `EulaSurface` panel, always in the DOM behind `v-show` even while
 * closed (see that component's own doc comment on why it is `v-show` and not `v-if`), and
 * the compact copy inside the wizard's `SetupEulaStep`. `page.waitForSelector(".mb-eula",
 * { state: "visible" })` resolves `document.querySelector(".mb-eula")` - the first match
 * in DOM order, which is the always-hidden standalone panel mounted earlier in `App.vue`'s
 * template - and polls *that* element's visibility, never the wizard's. It cannot become
 * visible while closed, so the wait times out no matter how long the budget is; run
 * 31003307669's trace shows exactly that (a clean 15000.0ms timeout, three times, once per
 * worker launch that run spawned) and a diagnostic screenshot moments later shows the real
 * step fully rendered - it was never slow, the wait was watching the wrong element the
 * whole time. Scope the wait to the dialog (`card.locator(".mb-eula")`) and it resolves in
 * about two seconds. Confirmed directly: `page.locator(".mb-eula").count()` is 2 once the
 * step mounts, and `.first().isVisible()` is `false`.
 *
 * **First-run setup is not "one surface" like the others.** It is the one dialog in the
 * whole application that is `persistent` - no Escape, no backdrop dismiss - which is
 * correct product behaviour for the one decision that genuinely must be made before
 * continuing, and exactly why a broken capture of it is not survivable the way a broken
 * capture of, say, the changelog viewer is. If `captureFirstRun` gives up mid-flow (from
 * the bug above, or anything else), the dialog stays open and its scrim blocks every click
 * anywhere else in the shell - not just for the rest of `beforeAll`, but for the first
 * click after every later `page.reload()`, because a reload remounts the app and asks
 * `needsFirstRun()` again, and the answer is still "yes" until the flow's own Finish
 * button has actually been reached. `captureFirstRun` therefore keeps photography and
 * flow-progress on separate failure paths - a failed screenshot must never stop the flow
 * from being driven to completion - and `beforeAll` checks afterwards, in
 * `ensureFirstRunClosed`, that the dialog is really gone before handing control to the
 * rest of the suite.

/**
 * Opens Settings if it is not already open, then switches to one section through the
 * panel's own search - the same route a person uses, and the only one this harness can
 * rely on regardless of which tab Settings was last showing.
 *
 * That last part is not hypothetical. `AppSettings.vue`'s `revealAnchor()` says so in its
 * own comment: opening the panel through the plain Settings FAB passes no anchor, and "no
 * anchor means just open it... no tab is switched, so whichever tab this surface last
 * remembered stays exactly where it was left" - deliberate app behaviour, a settings panel
 * that remembers where you were, not a bug. The "Settings sections" step below drives
 * through all six sections and leaves the last one (Language and tone) active when it
 * finishes; a later step that reopens Settings with the bare FAB and assumes the Mojang
 * consent tab is showing - because that used to be the only tab there was, before every
 * section became its own lazily-mounted tab - reopens on whatever the previous test left
 * behind instead, and a locator scoped to a tab that is not mounted times out looking for
 * an element that was never going to appear. That is what sent release `v0.1.0-build.419`
 * (run 31031646647) out with a red Screenshots job: "EULA viewer - the harness could not
 * open it in this run: locator.click: Timeout 15000ms exceeded", chasing
 * `.mb-consent-row button` on whatever tab happened to be left open rather than the one
 * that actually holds it.
