/**
 * Refusing to photograph a build that is older than the code.
 *
 * ## The trap this exists for
 *
 * The screenshot harness launches the real application and photographs what it shows. What
 * it shows is a *built* bundle, and the renderer's bundle is not built by the same command
 * as the main process:
 *
 * - `packages/app` → `npm run build` → `dist/main` and `dist/preload`
 * - `packages/ui`  → `vite build`    → `dist/assets/*.js` and `*.css` ← **everything on screen**
 *
 * So editing a Vue component, rebuilding `packages/app` and re-running the harness produces
 * captures of the *previous* UI, and every one of them passes. The change appears to have
 * done nothing. The natural next move is to change it harder — which is how a correct
 * one-line fix gets rewritten three times while the screenshots quietly show the old build.
 *
 * That happened. A notification toast was fixed, captured, and looked unchanged twice.
 *
 * Nothing about that failure is visible: no error, no warning, and a green run. So it is
 * checked here instead, before the application is ever launched.
 *
 * ## What it checks
 *
 * That every package whose output the harness photographs has a build newer than its
 * sources. Not that the build is *correct* — only that it is not older than the code being
 * tested, which is the one thing a screenshot cannot tell you by looking.
 *
 * It fails closed and names the command to run. A harness that warns about this would be
 * ignored exactly as reliably as no check at all, because the run still goes green.
