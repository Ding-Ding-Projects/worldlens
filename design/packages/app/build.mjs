/**
 * esbuild bundles every dependency the main process reaches except `electron` -
 * including pngjs (engine's Texture/LowresTile/atlas code, reached on essentially
 * every render) and anything else transitively pulled in that is itself a
 * CommonJS package. A CommonJS module's own `require("util")`/`require("zlib")`/
 * etc. calls, wrapped by esbuild's `__commonJS` helper, are left as calls to
 * esbuild's `__require` runtime shim rather than converted to static imports -
 * that shim is `typeof require !== "undefined" ? require : (...) => throw`, and a
 * plain Node ESM module (which is what `format: "esm"` produces, and what
 * Electron's ESM main-process entry point runs as) has no global `require` at
 * all. Reproduced directly: bundling a two-line pngjs smoke test with these exact
 * esbuild options throws "Dynamic require of \"util\" is not supported" the
 * moment `pngjs/lib/png.js` is first required - before any PNG operation runs,
 * because `png.js` requires `util` unconditionally at its own top level. Adding
 * `pngjs` (or anything else that hits this) to `external` is the wrong fix here:
 * electron-builder.config.cjs ships `dist/**\/*` and explicitly excludes
 * `node_modules` - the whole design is a self-contained bundle with nothing to
 * resolve an external import against at runtime.
 *
 * The same problem hits `__dirname`/`__filename`: esbuild leaves a bundled CJS
 * module's own `__dirname` references untouched too, and a plain ESM bundle has
 * no such global either. `@bokuweb/zstd-wasm`'s node entry point (reached from
 * `@worldlens/engine`'s `Compression.ZSTD`, which real Linear-format region
 * files decompress through) locates its `.wasm` binary with
 * `readFile(resolve(__dirname, './zstd.wasm'))` at its own top level - so loading
 * it after this bundle previously threw `ReferenceError: __dirname is not
 * defined` before any decompression ran. Reproduced directly the same way as the
 * pngjs case above: bundling a two-line `console.log(__dirname)` snippet with
 * these exact esbuild options leaves `__dirname` untouched in the output, and
 * running the result as `.mjs` throws that exact ReferenceError.
 *
 * The banner below gives the bundle its own real `require`, built from
 * `createRequire(import.meta.url)`, so the shim's `typeof require !== "undefined"`
 * check is true and the call resolves through Node's actual module system - which
 * always knows how to resolve a built-in like "util" or "zlib" regardless of
 * which file's URL created the `require`. It also derives `__dirname`/`__filename`
 * from that same `import.meta.url`, which - because the whole bundle is one
 * module once esbuild is done with it - always points at the bundle's own output
 * directory (`dist/main/`), the same directory `copyZstdWasmAsset` below copies
 * `zstd.wasm` into. This fixes every CommonJS dependency's builtin `require()`
 * and every `__dirname`/`__filename` reference uniformly, not only pngjs's or
 * zstd-wasm's, without shipping anything outside the bundle. Verified by
 * reproducing the exact failures and the fixes against a real pngjs encode/decode
 * and a real zstd compress/decompress round-trip with these same esbuild options.

 * Which current and legacy repositories this build's shipped updater should ask - decided

 *
 * This cannot be read from `process.env` at *runtime* the way `packages/site/vite.config.ts`
 * reads `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` for the Pages base path: a site rebuilds and redeploys on every
 * push, but an installed Electron app is a binary sitting on someone's disk with no
 * `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` anywhere near it. The runtime `WORLDLENS_UPDATE_FEED` override still
 * replaces both built-in feeds, but the ordinary rename path does not require an operator to
 * set it: the bundle carries the current feed and a bounded former-repository fallback.
 *
 * That permanence is exactly why this refuses rather than guesses. 114 installers already
 * shipped with the repository hardcoded as a string literal at the call site; a value that
 * is merely *wrong* here reproduces that exact defect one layer down, and does it silently -
 * a client asking a dead or wrong feed does not error, it just never hears about an update
 * again. So:
 *
 *  - `WORLDLENS_BUILD_REPOSITORY` explicitly names the current feed.
 *  - `WORLDLENS_LEGACY_BUILD_REPOSITORY`, or its old build-variable alias, explicitly names
 *    the bridge feed.
 *  - While CI still runs from the former repository, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` becomes the legacy
 *    feed and the current feed remains {@link DEFAULT_REPOSITORY}.
 *  - After CI moves to Worldlens, the same default legacy feed stays available for bridge
 *    clients. An unrelated fork uses itself as current and gets no implicit project fallback.
 *  - **Inside CI** (`CI` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS` is set) **with `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` missing or
 *    malformed, this throws instead of falling back.** GitHub Actions setting that variable
 *    is not optional, so its absence there means something is wrong with the job - a
 *    workflow that scrubs the environment, a runner outside GitHub's own infrastructure - and
 *    the fallback would be a wrong value baked into a real release rather than a convenience
 *    for a developer's laptop. A build that cannot determine its repository says so at build
 *    time, in a log a release fails loudly on, instead of shipping a binary that asks the
 *    wrong address forever.
