/**
 * The end-to-end proof issue #42 asks for: run the real CLI entry against a fixture map
 * directory (a real `packages/worldgen`-generated world, a real self-authored resource
 * pack — see `test/fixtures/resourcePack.ts`), then actually curl a tile/settings route
 * off the server it starts.
 *
 * Two levels, on purpose:
 *
 *   1. `runCli` (in-process) — the real orchestration `index.ts` calls, minus the
 *      `process.exit` wrapper, so the render and the running server can be inspected and
 *      torn down cleanly from a test. This is the bulk of the coverage: render lifecycle,
 *      real routes, the render-trigger route, graceful server shutdown.
 *   2. One subprocess spawn of the actual built `dist/index.js` — the literal executable a
 *      user or the Dockerfile runs, shebang included. This needs `pnpm --filter
 *      @worldlens/cli run build` to have already produced `dist/`, the same
 *      constraint `tools/oracle`'s harness documents for the engine's own `dist/`
 *      ("a run measures whatever was last compiled, NOT what is in src/"); it is not
 *      rebuilt here because doing so on every test run would make this one test dominate
 *      the whole suite's running time.
