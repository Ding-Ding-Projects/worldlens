/**
 * fetch-screenshots.mjs: collect a `screenshots` workflow artifact for the site's gallery.
 *
 * This script finds the most recent successful run that still has one, downloads it,
 * checks every file is genuinely a PNG, copies the images into the site's public
 * directory and writes a generated module describing them.
 *
 * That artifact is no longer produced. The capture job was removed from `ci.yml`, which
 * now builds and packages release inputs only, so the newest thing this can find is a
 * leftover artifact that has not yet aged out, and after that nothing. The script is kept
 * rather than deleted because it is what makes the absence honest: it degrades to the
 * unavailable state instead of throwing, and any surviving artifact stays usable to its
 * retention limit. Deleting it would leave the deploy workflow calling a missing file and
 * the gallery with a section that has no code behind it and no reason given for why it is
 * empty.
 *
 * The captures a reader actually sees are the committed ones under `docs/screenshots/`,
 * read out of the tree by `src/content/captures.ts`. Those are produced locally by the
 * capture matrix in `design/packages/app`, driven on a hidden Windows desktop, and moved
 * into the tree by `scripts/sync-screenshots.mjs` at the repository root. See
 * `.claude/skills/run-worldlens/SKILL.md` for how the matrix is run.
 *
 * When there is no artifact to be had, the generated module says so and gives the
 * reason. The gallery then renders its unavailable state. Nothing is substituted: a
 * placeholder in a gallery of real captures is indistinguishable from a real capture to
 * anyone scrolling, which makes it worse than an empty page.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/fetch-screenshots.mjs
 *   node scripts/fetch-screenshots.mjs --repo owner/name --workflow ci.yml --branch main
 *   node scripts/fetch-screenshots.mjs --out-dir public/screenshots --public-path screenshots
 *
 * Needs the GitHub CLI on PATH, authenticated with permission to read Actions. In a
 * workflow that means `permissions: actions: read`, which the deploy workflow declares.
