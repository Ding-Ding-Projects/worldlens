/**
 * The site's own copy, in English and in playful Hong Kong Cantonese, at all five funny
 * levels for each language independently.
 *
 * Two catalogues, because two kinds of string exist:
 *
 *   VOICED  Sentences, headings, help text, notifications and the action labels where the
 *           wording genuinely reads differently. Each entry carries five English strings and
 *           five Cantonese strings, index 0 being level 1 (fully professional) and index 4
 *           being level 5 (maximum playfulness).
 *
 *   FIXED   One-word and two-word control labels, proper nouns, mode names and the names of
 *           the funny levels themselves. These have one string per language. A level cannot
 *           usefully restyle the word "Close", and a control whose label moves under the
 *           visitor is a control they have to re-read every time.
 *
 * The level changes voice and nothing else. Every version number, count, date, keyboard
 * shortcut and description of what a control does is identical across all five levels of a
 * given entry; only the wrapping changes. An entry that made a fact vaguer at a higher level
 * would be a defect, not a joke.
 *
 * `{name}` placeholders are interpolated by the I18n class. Every level of an entry uses the
 * same placeholders, so a level can never drop a value out of a sentence.

/**
 * The literal substring(s) a `VOICED` entry's wording must keep at every funny level, in
 * both languages -- the same convention `packages/ui/src/copy/appCopy.ts`'s own `FACTS`
 * documents: the level styles the voice, and this is the mechanical check that it never
 * touches the one fact the sentence exists to state.
 *
 * `Partial` rather than mandatory for every `VOICED` key, unlike the UI package's stricter
 * version. This catalogue's roughly 150 pre-existing entries were written before this guard
 * existed, and auditing every one of them for the fact it is meant to pin is a separate pass
 * this addition does not claim to have done -- see `contract-localization.ts`'s own
 * `statusNote` for that gap tracked in the open. What this guarantees is narrower and honest
 * about it: every entry named here keeps its literal fact at every level in both languages,
 * checked by `strings.test.ts`, and every entry this pass adds for chrome that states a real
 * claim -- whether a verified release exists, that a page failed to start -- is named here
 * rather than left to human review alone.
