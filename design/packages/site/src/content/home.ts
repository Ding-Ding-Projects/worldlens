/**
 * Landing page copy.
 *
 * The rule this file is written under: say what exists, say what does not, and never
 * let a sentence read as though an unbuilt thing were shipped. The phase table below
 * mirrors `design/ROADMAP.md`, which is the source of truth. When the roadmap moves,
 * this moves in the same task.
 *
 * Two things this page has to get right, because everything else follows from them:
 *
 *   1. There are two render engines and only one of them runs. Upstream BlueMap's Java
 *      engine renders a local world today; the TypeScript mesher is being written and
 *      takes over when its output is byte-identical. A page that lists both without
 *      saying which is which lets a reader conclude the port is finished.
 *   2. Every number here is countable and every card says how much of its subject is
 *      actually built. A status badge that says shipped means shipped.
