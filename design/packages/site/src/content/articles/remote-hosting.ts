    summary:
        "Publish an already-rendered map to a Linux server you own, over the same SSH/Docker foundation remote rendering uses, as a detached container that keeps answering after this application closes - loopback by default, a warned public choice, and live verification before anything is called live.",

    statusNote:
        "The docker-run plan, the orchestrator (preflight, upload, replace-and-start, both verification paths, the persisted record) and the IPC seam are built and covered by 46 tests in design/packages/app/src/main/remote/ and design/packages/ui/src/components/remote/, all against fakes - no real SSH client, Docker daemon or server anywhere in the run. The panel component is reachable end to end through the preload bridge, but is not yet mounted into the application's own tab navigation, and this article says so rather than implying it is one click away.",
