    title: "Bedrock Edition worlds: detecting them, and converting them with Chunker",
    summary:
        "BlueMap renders Java Edition only, so a Bedrock Edition world is detected and named for what it is rather than reported as corrupt, and can then be converted to Java with Chunker's CLI, in bounded batches for worlds too large for one JVM, with every loss stated before the conversion runs.",
    category: "application",
    status: "shipped",
    statusNote:
        "Detection, the Chunker driver, the fidelity briefing, provenance recording and batched conversion for large worlds are on the default branch, covered by 134 tests across ten files (124 in the main process, 10 in the interface), all with the process runner injected. What used to be the one open question - whether a real Chunker jar, a real JVM and a real Bedrock world actually behave the way that logic assumes - has now been run for real, through this app's own production code rather than a shell replica of it: see Verification below. Batching and out-of-memory recovery remain proven from the CLI's source and from injected-runner tests only, because reproducing either for real needs a world past roughly 200 MB, which does not belong in a repository.",
