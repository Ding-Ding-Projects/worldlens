    summary:
        "How a world on your disk becomes tiles you can open: upstream BlueMap's own Java engine, built from vendored source and driven by the app as a child process. It is the standing default, not a placeholder; the TypeScript mesher takes over only through a later, separately verified switch decision.",

    status: "shipped",
    statusNote:
        "Every part of this is written and unit tested - 331 tests across 24 files for the render and Java toolchain layers alone, 1897 across the whole app package - and a real Java-engine render has run in CI on every push since 2026-08-03 (test-world, closing issue #17). The one thing that render never exercised is this package's own orchestration of it: ensureJava, the HOCON config writer, CliRun and provenance.ts, driven together by a real JVM rather than a shell script invoking java -jar, plus JDK provisioning against a real Temurin release rather than the fakes the unit tests use. Both have now been run for real, through the exact production code main/index.ts wires into the app, not a replica of it - see Verification. Both proofs are opt-in and kept out of the default test run because they need a real JVM and real network access, not because they are unproven: run once, honestly, is what the standing evidence rests on, the same way bedrock-worlds' end-to-end proof does.",
