/**
 * The ordered article list.
 *
 * Order is reading order, not alphabetical: application first because that is what a
 * visitor met on the landing page, then the engine underneath it, then how it is
 * built and delivered, then the contracts, each of which is written down and only
 * partly built.
 *
 * The cross-cutting application features sit together near the end of the application
 * run rather than beside the surface each one happens to appear on, because they are
 * the same shape of thing: one mechanism reached from everywhere. A reader who has
 * just met the palette is far more likely to want the notification centre next than
 * to want the Electron security posture.
 *
 * Each of those has a contract article as its counterpart. They are deliberately not
 * merged: this run says what is built, the contract run says what was asked for, and
 * collapsing the two would leave nowhere to record the difference between them.
