        "The downloader, the zip reader, the release reader, the cross-repository fetcher in main/worldsource/ and the surface are built and covered by 185 tests: 131 in the main process (72 in main/download, 51 in main/worldsource, 8 in the preload adapter that wires the two of them to the panel) and 54 in the interface, all running in CI. One test drives the whole manifest path end to end against a real split archive; another drives the whole checksum-list path end to end against a real cross-repository release. No release has been fetched from github.com through this shipped surface, and there is no capture of it doing so.",
