/**
 * The site's own copy of the promise `packages/ui`'s `superConfirmPolicy.test.ts` enforces:
 * every destructive action is behind the gate, including the next one nobody has written yet.
 *
 * A no-regression audit found that guard, and its neighbour `notificationPolicy.test.ts`,
 * sweep only `packages/ui/src`. `design/packages/site/src` is a separate package with its own
 * destructive actions -- deleting an appearance preset, forgetting every stored preference,
 * closing a batch of tabs -- and none of it was covered: a new destructive control could ship
 * here ungated and every existing guard would stay green, because none of them were ever
 * pointed at this source tree. This file closes that gap for the site the same way the UI
 * package's own file does: as an inventory. Every call site in this package that destroys or
 * forgets something is declared below with what it destroys and where it stands, and a new one
 * fails this file until somebody writes that sentence down.
 *
 * The declaration is deliberately awkward to fill in dishonestly, for the same reason the UI
 * package's version is: it is easy to wire a delete button to a store method, and much harder
 * to write, in a file a reviewer reads, that the thing being removed is unrecoverable and that
 * nothing stands in front of it. An entry may say a gate is not needed, but only in one of a
 * fixed set of words, each checkable. Inventing a sixth excuse means editing the union type,
 * which shows up in the diff.
 *
 * The site has one gate rather than the UI package's two: `settings/confirm.ts`'s
 * `confirmDestructive`, a modal two-key-and-slider dialog. There is no anchored variant here
 * because the site never has "nowhere to anchor" -- everything that can destroy something is
 * already inside a page with room for a dialog -- so a second presentation would be a
 * distinction with no surface that needs it.
 *
 * This file is deliberately not in the jsdom environment its neighbour uses: under jsdom
 * `import.meta.url` is not a `file:` URL, so `fileURLToPath` throws before a single assertion
 * runs. `settings/confirm.test.ts` already covers the gate's own behaviour under jsdom; this
 * file only ever reads source text.

 * The first pattern is the same net for the same reason: `deleteSomething(`, `removeSomething(`,

 * having to know they exist, because a list of known primitives only ever protects against the
 * deletes somebody already thought about. The same five DOM/URL cleanup methods are cut out by
 * exact identifier -- `removeEventListener`, `removeProperty`, `removeChild`, `removeAttribute`,
 * `revokeObjectURL` -- because this package tidies up after itself with all five and a guard
 * that reports every teardown is a guard nobody reads.
 *
 * The rest are this package's own named primitives that do not follow the verb-prefix
 * convention and would otherwise slip past: forgetting every stored preference or every
 * customised element, and closing a batch of tabs in one call. They are matched narrowly for
 * the same reason the UI package's own narrow patterns are: a guard that fired on `reset()` in
 * general would fire on every form's Cancel-and-reset button in the package.
