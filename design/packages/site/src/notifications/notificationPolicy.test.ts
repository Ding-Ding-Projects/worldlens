/**
 * The site's own copy of the two promises `packages/ui`'s `notificationPolicy.test.ts`
 * enforces, closing the same coverage gap `settings/destructiveActionPolicy.test.ts` closes
 * for destructive actions: a no-regression audit found both of the UI package's guards sweep
 * only `packages/ui/src`, so a blocking dialog could ship in `design/packages/site/src` in
 * place of a non-blocking toast and every existing guard would stay green.
 *
 * "Everything that only informs becomes a notification" is a claim about every future surface
 * as much as about the existing ones, so -- exactly like the UI package's version -- it is
 * enforced as an inventory: every application-modal surface in this package is declared below
 * with the decision it asks the user to make, and a new one fails this file until somebody
 * writes that sentence down.
 *
 * "No nagging. Not now, not later" is the same shape for the same reason: a scan for the copy,
 * over every shipped file in the package including the marketing and documentation content
 * this package renders that the UI package has no equivalent of.
 *
 * This file is deliberately not in the jsdom environment `Notifications.test.ts` uses: under
 * jsdom `import.meta.url` is not a `file:` URL, so `fileURLToPath` throws before a single
 * assertion runs.
