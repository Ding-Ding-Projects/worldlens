 * not a constant: a fork, a rename or a second repository publishing the same site all
 * serve it from a different prefix. A CI probe in a repository named
 * `worldlens-ci-probe` built a site whose every asset pointed at
 * `/worldlens/`, which is exactly the silent failure the base-path gate exists to
 * catch, arriving through the one door the gate could not see because it was checking
 * against the same hard-coded value.
 *
 * `SITE_BASE` wins when set. Otherwise the GitHub Actions-provided `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`
