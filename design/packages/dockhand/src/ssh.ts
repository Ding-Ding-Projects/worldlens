/**
 * Talking to the remote host, through the OpenSSH client the person already trusts.
 *
 * There is no SSH library here, and that is a decision rather than an omission. Using the
 * system `ssh` means the person's agent, their `~/.ssh/config`, their hardware key and
 * their jump hosts all keep working, and it means this app never holds, parses, decrypts
 * or writes key material of any kind. A library would have to be handed a private key to
 * be useful, and the moment that is possible it is the thing that leaks.
 *
 * ## The options are the security model
 *
 * Every invocation carries the same block, and each line of it prevents a specific failure:
 *
 * ```
 * BatchMode=yes                     never prompt. A prompt in a background process is a hang.
 * PasswordAuthentication=no         no password is ever offered, even if the host asks.
 * KbdInteractiveAuthentication=no   the other way a host asks for a password.
 * PreferredAuthentications=publickey  do not even try the rest.
 * StrictHostKeyChecking=yes         an unknown key is a refusal, never a silent trust.
 * UserKnownHostsFile=<app> <user>   read both; write only the app's own.
 * ConnectTimeout=<n>                a dead host fails in seconds, not in a TCP timeout.
 * ```
 *
 * `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes` is the one that matters most. `accept-new` would make the
 * first connection to any host succeed silently, which is exactly the connection a
 * machine-in-the-middle needs to survive. The refusal it produces is turned into a decision
 * for the person by `hostkey.ts`.
 *
 * ## Quoting
 *
 * `ssh host <words>` does not run an argv. It joins the words with spaces and hands the
 * string to the remote **login shell**, which then splits, globs and expands it. So a
 * world folder called `Saves, old (2)` or a path with a `$` in it is not an edge case, it
 * is a broken command - or worse, a different command. Every word this module sends is
 * single-quoted by {@link quoteForRemoteShell} first, which is the only quoting a POSIX
 * shell has no way to reinterpret.
