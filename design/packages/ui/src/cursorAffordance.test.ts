/**
 * A style-source sweep for the class of defect filed as "the full GUI has a 'mouse click'
 * cursor": a `cursor: pointer` rule reaching a root, wildcard or shell-level selector, which
 * `cursor` being an inherited property then carries down into every plain heading, panel and
 * stretch of empty space under it.
 *
 * The actual bug (see `components/appearance/AppearanceTarget.test.ts`, "the wrapper's own
 * cursor") turned out not to be an authored selector at all: Vuetify's own normalize
 * stylesheet answers `[aria-controls]` with `cursor: pointer`, and Vuetify's `<v-menu
 * :activator="root">` wiring writes `aria-controls` onto `AppearanceTarget.vue`'s wrapper -
 * which the appearance contract puts around *every* rendered element. That file carries its
 * own dedicated regression test for the fix. This file is the other half: a standing guard
 * against a *plain, hand-written* broad selector ever being added directly to one of the
 * shell surfaces that legitimately cover large regions of the window - `App.vue`'s own
 * `<style>`, and the two global stylesheets `main.ts` loads for the whole application,
 * `styles/global.scss` and `styles/markers.scss`.
 *
 * A `?raw` style-source read rather than a mounted `getComputedStyle` assertion, for the same
 * reason `tabGroupPickerMount.test.ts` reads `TabGroupPicker.vue?raw`: this workspace's
 * `vitest.config.ts` does not enable `test.css`, so a mounted component's `<style>` block is
 * never injected into jsdom's `document.head`, and `getComputedStyle` would read empty (or,
 * worse, silently pass by never seeing a real leak at all) regardless of what any file here
 * actually declares.

 *
 * The four `.mb-shell-*` and `.mb-map-page` entries replace a single `.mb-shell-tabs`, which was
 * the pre-rewrite shell's full-bleed tab container. That class was deleted by the Material
 * Design 3 rewrite and the token went on sitting in this list naming nothing - a guard that
 * still passed, still read as covering the shell, and could no longer catch anything, which is
 * strictly worse than an absent entry because it looks like coverage. The surface it used to
 * stand for is now four: `.mb-shell-body` is the whole window below the title bar, and
 * `.mb-shell-content` the column beside the rail; `.mb-shell-layer` is each of the three stacked
 * destinations, every one of them `inset: 0`; and `.mb-map-page` fills whichever box the shell
 * leaves for the map. A `cursor: pointer` on any of them inherits into everything a person
 * looks at, which is precisely the filed bug this file exists to keep out.
