/**
 * The pinned inventory of every context menu in the app package, and the guard that keeps
 * it honest.
 *
 * This is two halves, and both have to hold for the file to do its job:
 *
 *   - **The rule half.** A menu registered here as `"has-search"` must actually carry a
 *     filterable search field -- checked by grepping the real, live source file for one of
 *     the components that provide it (`ConfigSearchField`, `MenuSearchList`, `TabMenuList`,
 *     or a documented per-entry override), never by trusting the registry's own say-so.
 *   - **The list half.** `REGISTRY` is checked against a live sweep of every `.vue` file
 *     under `packages/ui/src/components` for a literal `<v-menu` tag or an
 *     `<AppearanceTarget` wrapper, which is how every context menu in this application is
 *     actually built. A file the sweep finds that `REGISTRY` does not mention fails the
 *     suite; so does a `REGISTRY` entry naming a file the sweep no longer finds one in. A
 *     brand new context menu therefore cannot ship silently unlisted, and neither can a
 *     stale entry survive a menu being removed.
 *
 * `"pending"` is the escape hatch for a menu this task found bare but is not allowed to
 * touch, because another lane owns the file it lives in right now. Each one names its owner
 * in a comment beside it, exactly as the task asked, so the guard does not fail on work that
 * belongs to somebody else's lane -- and so the next person to touch that file knows this
 * gap is already tracked rather than a surprise.
 *
 * `"not-applicable"` is for a `<v-menu>` that is not a command list at all -- a colour
 * picker, a font picker, a date range, a regex builder, a destructive-action gate. The
 * search-bar contract is about filtering a list of things to do; a value editor with one
 * job has nothing to filter, and forcing a search field onto it would be decoration, not a
 * feature.
 *
 * `"no-menu"` documents a surface the task's own scouting confirmed has no context menu of
 * any kind today (the title bar, the map canvas), so a reader does not mistake its absence
 * from the swept set for an oversight.
