/**
 * Having GitHub's runners render a world this computer cannot.
 *
 * ## What this screen is for, said out loud
 *
 * Rendering a large world is hours of CPU and gigabytes of disk. On a thin laptop that is
 * an afternoon of the fan at full speed and nothing else usable, and on some machines it
 * simply does not finish. A GitHub runner has four cores, fourteen gigabytes of free disk
 * and nothing else to do. This screen sends the world there and brings the map back.
 *
 * The trade-offs are on the screen too, not in a footnote. Uploading a multi-gigabyte
 * world takes hours on a domestic connection; a private repository's Actions minutes are
 * finite where a public repository's are not; and a world past a release asset's ceiling
 * cannot be dispatched at all. Advertising the upside without those is how somebody spends
 * an afternoon finding them out.
 *
 * ## Three things here are deliberate and read as omissions if they are not stated
 *
 * **Two consents, and neither is pre-ticked.** Uploading a world sends it to GitHub, and a
 * PUBLIC repository makes it downloadable by anybody - a world carries builds, coordinates
 * and whatever a friend left in a chest. The main process refuses without both, because a
 * guard that lives only in the renderer is not a guard.
 *
 * **Mojang's licence is not accepted here.** The workflow accepts it on the repository
 * owner's behalf, which is a real legal acceptance. This screen reports that it has not
 * been given and points at the settings row that already asks; there is no second tick box
 * for it anywhere in this feature.
 *
 * **Which GitHub credential is in play is shown before the button.** A machine typically
 * holds two - this application's sign-in and `gh`'s - and "permission denied" is
 * unactionable when a person cannot tell which one was refused.
 *
 * **More than one signed-in account, and picking one here never touches the others.** The
 * application can hold several GitHub accounts side by side
 * (`GitHubAccountsList.vue` in Settings is where they are added, removed and made active);
 * before this picker existed, every call this screen made - who could own the repository,
 * whether the world was uploaded before, the credential that actually dispatches the
 * workflow - resolved to whichever one was *active*, with no way to render as a different
 * signed-in account short of switching in Settings and back. "Render as" is a *local*
 * choice: picking a different stored account here re-reads the owner list for it and
 * carries its id through the check and the render, but it never calls the active-account
 * switch Settings uses. Downloads, backups and every other GitHub-authenticated feature
 * keep running on whichever account was already active, and leaving the picker untouched
 * behaves exactly as it always did.

                    bilingual mode doubles it again. `VCardTitle` defaults to `overflow:
                    hidden; white-space: nowrap; text-overflow: ellipsis`, and this row's own
                    `d-flex` turns it into a flex container that ellipsis never actually
                    paints (text-overflow has no effect on a flex formatting context), so the
                    title and the state chip were silently clipped at the card edge with no
                    visible cue anything was missing. `ci-row__title` wins on specificity
                    (a scoped class beats Vuetify's bare `.v-card-title`) and lets the row
