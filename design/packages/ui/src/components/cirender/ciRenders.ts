/**
 * The CI-render surface's state, kept out of the component so it can be tested without one.
 *
 * Built to the shape `components/backup/backups.ts` established, and for the same reasons:
 * one row per sync keyed by id so an event for a sync started in another window lands in
 * the right place, a bounded log so a four-hour render does not grow one without limit,
 * and byte formatting **imported** rather than written again - `1.7 GB` has to read
 * identically whether somebody is watching a world leave or a map arrive.
 *
 * ## Nothing here decides that a run succeeded
 *
 * The row's state is whatever the main process last said, and a run with no conclusion is
 * shown as running rather than as nearly finished. {@link jobTone} maps a job's real
 * status onto a colour and deliberately has no branch that turns "in progress" into
 * anything hopeful: a green tick beside a job that has not finished is the one thing a
 * progress surface must never draw.
