/**
 * The seam between the CI-render surface and the main process.
 *
 * Every type here is a structural mirror of the one the Electron preload exposes on
 * `window.worldlens`, restated rather than imported for the same reason
 * `backupBridge.ts` and `downloadBridge.ts` restate theirs: this package compiles and runs
 * in three places and only one of them has a preload. Importing across that boundary would
 * also drag the zip writer, the fingerprint walker and `node:fs` into the renderer's
 * bundle, which is exactly what the preload was split out to prevent.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a capability. {@link resolveCiRenderBridge} returns `null` when the
 * three methods a CI render cannot happen without are missing, and the rest are probed one
 * at a time and reported as flags.
 *
 * ## The token is not here, and neither is the licence
 *
 * Nothing on this bridge carries a credential in either direction, and nothing on it can
 * *accept* Mojang's EULA. The surface learns from a refusal that the acceptance is missing
 * and points at the settings row that already asks; it never offers a second place to
 * agree. A legal acceptance with two front doors is one people click through.
