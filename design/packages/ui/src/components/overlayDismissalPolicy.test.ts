/**
 * "Right click menu not closing when clicking off the menu" -- kept fixed by a test rather
 * than by remembering, and generalised to every overlay this package can open, not only the
 * one the report named.
 *
 * ## The mechanism, traced rather than guessed
 *
 * Every popover-shaped surface in this package is Vuetify's `<v-menu>` (built on
 * `VOverlay`), which already supplies Escape handling, window-listener teardown and
 * outside-click detection via its own `v-click-outside` directive -- one shared primitive,
 * not a document listener reinvented per file. That directive treats a click as "outside"
 * unless it lands inside the overlay's own content OR inside whatever `VOverlay`'s
 * `useActivator` composable resolved as `activatorEl`:
 *
 * ```
 * // VOverlay.js
 * include: () => [activatorEl.value]
 * ```
 *
 * `activatorEl` comes from the `:activator` prop, and only from that prop -- reading
 * `useActivator.js` shows `target` (positioning) and `activatorEl` (click-outside inclusion,
 * hover, focus, and the `aria-haspopup`/`aria-controls`/`aria-expanded` wiring) are resolved
 * independently:
 *
 * ```
 * const target = computed(() => {
 *     if (props.target === 'cursor' && cursorTarget.value) return cursorTarget.value;
 *     if (targetRef.value) return targetRef.el;
 *     return getTarget(props.target, vm) || activatorEl.value;
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * So a `<v-menu>` that sets an explicit `:target` for positioning (a pointer coordinate, a
 * specific anchor element) *and* a separate dynamic `:activator` for its ARIA wiring gets
 * positioned by `:target` but still treats the *entire* `:activator` element as permanently
 * "inside" for outside-click purposes -- regardless of where `:target` actually put the
 * overlay on screen. `AppearanceTarget.vue` did exactly this: `:activator="root"` where
 * `root` is the whole wrapped surface (for `id="app.tabBar"`, the entire tab bar and every
 * page under it), so almost any click anywhere in the application landed "inside" `root` and
 * the outside-click directive waved it through. That is the reported bug, traced to the
 * exact line.
 *
 * The fix used throughout this file's own history is not "delete `:activator`, lose the
 * ARIA wiring" -- `aria-haspopup`/`aria-controls`/`aria-expanded` are real accessibility
 * information a screen-reader user needs, and `useActivator` only writes them when
 * `:activator` is set. The correct shape, and the one this test enforces, is: a `<v-menu>`
 * that needs `:target` for positioning wires its own `aria-haspopup`/`aria-expanded`/
 * `aria-controls` by hand and never *also* binds a dynamic `:activator` -- see
 * `AppearanceTarget.vue`'s `menuId`/`editorId` for the worked example. `activator="parent"`
 * on a small dedicated trigger (a bell icon, a `+` button) stays exactly as safe as it always
 * was: `:target` is never set alongside it, so there is nothing to collide with.
 *
 * ## The two-part guard
 *
 *  1. **The mechanism sweep.** Every `<v-menu>` tag under `packages/ui/src` is parsed for a
 *     dynamic (non-`"parent"`) `:activator` binding *and* an explicit `:target` binding at
 *     the same time. Finding both on one tag is the defect, full stop -- this is checked
 *     structurally, so a brand new overlay written the same wrong way next month fails this
 *     file exactly as `AppearanceTarget.vue` would have, without anyone updating a list.
 *     Alongside it: no swept `<v-menu>` may set `persistent`, which would silently disable
 *     both Escape and outside-click dismissal at once -- the other easy way to reintroduce
 *     this exact bug class.
 *  2. **The declared inventory.** Every file that either owns a `<v-menu>` or wraps content
 *     in the shared `<AppearanceTarget>` wrapper (which brings its own two `<v-menu>`s along
 *     for free) is named below with its current dismissal status, cross-checked against the
 *     live sweep rather than trusted. `"pending"` names a surface this task's own scouting
 *     found broken, with the owner fixing it; a `"pending"` entry whose file the live sweep
 *     now finds clean fails this test too, which is what forces the entry to be promoted to
 *     `"clean"` the moment the real fix lands, rather than the registry quietly going stale.
 *
 * A file wrapped in `<AppearanceTarget>` gets exactly one thing to say about the mechanism:
 * whichever way `AppearanceTarget.vue` itself is wired, every one of its callers is wired the
 * same way, because it is the one shared component doing the work for all of them. That is
 * also why fixing `AppearanceTarget.vue` alone clears every row below that only wraps it.
