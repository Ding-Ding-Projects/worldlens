/**
 * The seam between the backup surface and the main process.
 *
 * Every type here is a structural mirror of the one the Electron preload exposes on
 * `window.worldlens`, restated rather than imported for the same reason
 * `downloadBridge.ts` restates its own: this package compiles and runs in three places and
 * only one of them has a preload. Importing across that boundary would also drag the zip
 * writer, the splitter and `node:fs` into the renderer's bundle, which is exactly what the
 * preload was split out to prevent.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a capability. {@link resolveBackupBridge} returns `null` when the
 * three methods a backup cannot happen without are missing, and the rest are probed one at
 * a time and reported as flags. A missing `cancelBackup` in particular is survivable and
 * must not be hidden: a backup that cannot be stopped is worth knowing about *before* one
 * is started on a twenty gigabyte world, not after.
 *
 * ## The token is not here, and never will be
 *
 * Nothing on this bridge carries a credential in either direction. The main process holds
 * the GitHub session and resolves a token per operation; this side learns whether somebody
 * is signed in only from a refusal that says so.
