/**
 * The clause of issue #10 that is a promise about code nobody has written yet.
 *
 * "Every destructive action in the app is behind the gate" is a claim about the next delete
 * button as much as about the five that exist today, so it is enforced the way its
 * neighbour `components/notifications/notificationPolicy.test.ts` enforces "everything that
 * only informs becomes a notification": as an inventory. Every call site in this package
 * that destroys or forgets something is declared below with what it destroys and where it
 * stands, and a new one fails this file until somebody writes that sentence down.
 *
 * The declaration is the whole mechanism, and it is deliberately awkward to fill in
 * dishonestly. It is very easy to add `@click="remove(id)"` to a row; it is much harder to
 * write, in a file a reviewer reads, that the thing being removed is unrecoverable and that
 * nothing is standing in front of it. An entry may say a gate is not needed, but it may
 * only say so in one of a fixed set of words, each of which means something specific and
 * checkable. Inventing a sixth excuse means editing the union type, which shows up in the
 * diff. "It is only small" is not one of the five.
 *
 * Two further things are pinned here because they are structural rather than behavioural,
 * and a mounted test would not notice either going wrong:
 *
 *  - Both gates run the one shared state machine. Two components drawing two cards is fine;
 *    two components each doing their own key-and-slider arithmetic is how one of them ends
 *    up firing at 90% and nobody finds out for a release.
 *  - Each gate still contains every part the contract lists. Nothing stops somebody
 *    "simplifying" the Emergency exit or the reduced-motion block out of a card that goes
 *    on passing every interaction test, so the parts are asserted by name.
 *
 * This file is deliberately not in the jsdom environment its mounted neighbour uses: under
 * jsdom `import.meta.url` is not a `file:` URL, so `fileURLToPath` throws before a single
 * assertion runs.

/**
 * What a destructive call site looks like.
 *
 * The first pattern is the net, and it is a naming convention rather than a list: anything
 * called `deleteSomething(`, `removeSomething(`, `purgeSomething(` and so on is caught the
 * day it is written, without this file having to know it exists. That is the property that
 * makes the guard worth having, because a list of known primitives only ever protects
 * against the deletes somebody already thought about.
 *
 * Four DOM and URL methods are cut out of that net by name. `removeEventListener`,
 * `removeProperty`, `removeChild`, `removeAttribute` and `revokeObjectURL` are how this
 * package tidies up after itself on unmount, they appear in about a dozen files, and a
 * guard that reports all of them is a guard whose output nobody reads. They are excluded by
 * exact identifier rather than by prefix, so a `removeChildMap(` of our own still matches.
 *
 * The rest are the primitives whose names do not follow the convention and would otherwise
 * slip past: signing out, resetting every setting, emptying a stored directory choice,
 * closing tabs in bulk, and stopping work that is in flight. They are matched narrowly,
 * because a guard that fires on `cancel()` in general fires on the Cancel button of every
 * form in the package and is switched off within a week.
 *
 * Word boundaries are hand-rolled rather than `\b` so that a member call such as
 * `workspace.removeEntry(...)` still matches while `canRemoveEntry(` does not: the leading
 * class excludes an identifier character before the verb, and the verb itself is lower case,
 * so a camel-case prefix cannot produce a match.

 * Where a destructive call site stands with respect to the contract. Five of these are
 * fine and one is a defect, and they are a closed set on purpose.
 *
 *  - `gated`      The super-confirmation gate stands in front of it. `gatedIn` names the
 *                 file holding that gate, which is not always the file making the call: the
 *                 config editor stages removals in one screen and performs them in another.
 *  - `type-only`  A declaration of a host method rather than a call to one. The preload
 *                 bridge's `.d.ts` destroys nothing by existing; its callers are declared
 *                 separately and carry the gate.
 *  - `buffer`     Mutates the unsaved in-memory config workspace. Nothing has left the disk,
 *                 reopening the folder restores it in full, and the apply dialog names every
 *                 file that would actually be deleted before anything is.
 *  - `reversible` The user can put the state straight back through the same control. A
 *                 withdrawn consent is granted again; a forgotten path is chosen again.
 *  - `resumable`  Survivable rather than destructive. What has already been produced is kept
 *                 on purpose and the work resumes from it.
 *  - `unwired`    Model code with no user-facing caller yet. The gate is owed by whoever
 *                 wires it, and this declaration is what makes them notice.
 *  - `gap`        Shipped, reachable, and not behind the gate. A defect, named as one, with
 *                 the issue it is tracked under.
