 * warnings and errors stay until dismissed, so a failure cannot scroll past
 * unread. Everything that was raised stays reachable in the history, because a
 * message that vanished and cannot be found again is a message that may as well
 * not have been shown.
 *
 * The history itself is no longer a list in a menu here. The bell opens
 * `components/notifications/NotificationCentre.vue`, which searches, filters by
 * level and can put a notice back on screen; a flat column of message strings
 * was a control that looked like a notification centre in a screenshot and was

            The stack is the same element it always was - `TransitionGroup` renders the
            `tag` it is given, so the class, the live region and the scroll behaviour are
            unchanged - and the toasts inside it now arrive and leave through
            `styles/motion.scss`'s `mb-notice` class family rather than blinking in and out.

            A group rather than a plain `Transition` because the stack is a list: several
            toasts can be arriving and leaving at once, and each has to be tracked by its own
            key. `styles/motion.scss` explains why the leaving toast stays in flow rather
            than sliding the others into its gap, and why it goes `pointer-events: none` on
            the way out - for those 150ms it is a control panel for a notice the user has
            already sent away.
