/**
 * Every word the first-run flow and the consent settings row put on screen, in English
 * and in playful Hong Kong Cantonese.
 *
 * Three catalogues, because three kinds of string exist here and they have genuinely
 * different rules:
 *
 *   VOICED  Headings, leads and help text, where the wording really does read
 *           differently at different funny levels. Five English strings and five
 *           Cantonese strings each, index 0 being level 1 (fully professional) and
 *           index 4 being level 5 (maximum playfulness).
 *
 *   FIXED   Control labels, step names, mode names and the names of the funny levels
 *           themselves. One string per language. A level cannot usefully restyle the
 *           word "Back", and a button whose label moves under somebody is a button they
 *           have to re-read every time.
 *
 *   EXACT   The consent facts. One string per language, and the funny level may not
 *           touch them at any setting. These are the sentences that say what is being
 *           agreed to, what accepting permits, and what declining costs. `exactKeys()`
 *           enumerates them so a test can prove level 1 and level 5 produce byte
 *           identical text, rather than that being a promise in a comment.
 *
 * The quotation itself is not in any catalogue. It is `CONSENT_QUOTE`, upstream
 * BlueMap's own wording copied without a character changed, and it is shown in English
 * in every language mode. `CONSENT_QUOTE_TRANSLATION` sits underneath it in Cantonese
 * and bilingual modes, labelled as a reading of the quotation rather than as the
 * quotation, because replacing the text somebody is agreeing to with a translation of
 * it changes what they agreed to.
 *
 * Placeholders are `{name}`. Every level of an entry uses the same placeholders, so a
 * level can never drop a value out of a sentence.
