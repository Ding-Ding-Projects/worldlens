/**
 * First-run setup and the consent settings row.
 *
 * `FirstRunSetup` is the whole flow. Mount exactly one of them in the shell; it decides
 * for itself whether this is a first launch and stays invisible when it is not.
 *
 * `ConsentSettingsRow` is the other end of the same record, for the settings page. It is
 * where a render that lacks consent points somebody, which is why the flow never asks
 * the question a second time.
