/**
 * The one live object the update surfaces share.
 *
 * Holds the state the main process pushes, subscribes once, and exposes the two pure models
 * from `updateModel.ts` as computed values. Two surfaces read it - the banner and the
 * settings row - and they must never hold two copies: a banner still offering to install
 * 0.2.0 beside a row that has already installed it is the failure a second copy produces.
 *
 * Everything is injectable. The bridge is a parameter, so a test drives the whole thing
 * with a stand-in and no preload; the dismissal is read through
 * `components/setup/setupPrefs.ts`, which every test in this package already swaps for an
 * in-memory store.
