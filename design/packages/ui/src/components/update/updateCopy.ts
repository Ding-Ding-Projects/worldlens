/**
 * The words the update surfaces say, in three language modes at five funny levels each.
 *
 * Its own catalogue rather than an entry in `copy/appCopy.ts`, for the same reason
 * `components/setup/setupStrings.ts` has one: this surface is self-contained, and a feature
 * that carries its own copy can be added, tested and reviewed without touching a catalogue
 * every other screen also reads from. It resolves the mode and the two levels from the same
 * persisted store everything else uses (`setup/setupI18n.ts`), so there is exactly one
 * language setting in the application and this is not a second one.
 *
 * ## What the level may never touch
 *
 * Two things, and the split is structural rather than a convention somebody has to
 * remember:
 *
 *  - **Version numbers and dates.** They arrive as `{version}` placeholders and are
 *    interpolated after the string is chosen, so no level can reach them. A message that
 *    reads "0.2.0 is tapping its foot" at level 5 still says `0.2.0`, exactly.
 *  - **What a button does.** Every action label lives in {@link UPDATE_FIXED}, which has one
 *    string per language and never consults a level at all. There is no code path through
 *    which a funny level can reach the word "Restart".
 *
 * Everything else - the sentence around the fact - is styled freely, including the failure
 * copy, because the rule is voice-not-facts rather than a carve-out for serious categories.
 * A level-5 failure message is still required to say that nothing was installed and nothing
 * changed; it is simply allowed to be funny about it.
