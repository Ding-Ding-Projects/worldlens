/**
 * The seam between the update banner and the main process.
 *
 * Every type here is a structural mirror of the one the Electron preload exposes on
 * `window.worldlens`, restated rather than imported for the same reason
 * `backupBridge.ts` restates its own: this package compiles and runs in three places and
 * only one of them has a preload.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a capability. {@link resolveUpdateBridge} returns `null` when the
 * two methods an update surface cannot exist without are missing, and the rest are probed
 * one at a time and reported as flags. A missing `restartToInstallUpdate` in particular is
 * survivable and must not be hidden: a Restart button that throws when pressed is far worse
 * than a banner that says this build cannot install the update it found.
 *
 * ## No credential crosses this
 *
 * `feedUrl` is the address updates come from and nothing else. The main process builds it
 * through `describeFeed`, which exists precisely so the interface can say where updates come
 * from without being told how the app authenticates to the server.
