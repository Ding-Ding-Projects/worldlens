/**
 * The seam between the `gh` command-line tool's own account surface and the main process.
 *
 * A file of its own, deliberately separate from `githubBridge.ts` next door, for the same
 * reason the two account stores are never merged in the interface: `gh` keeps its own
 * credential store, shared by every terminal, script and other tool on this machine, and it
 * is not this application's own multi-account store `githubBridge.ts` already describes.
 * Reusing that file's `GitHubBridge` type for these two methods would make it look, from a
 * type signature alone, like one list - which is exactly the impression every surface using
 * this module has to avoid giving.
 *
 * Every type here is a structural mirror of what the Electron preload exposes on
 * `window.worldlens`, restated rather than imported, for the same reason
 * `githubBridge.ts` restates its own slice: this package compiles and runs in three places
 * (the desktop app, a browser tab, and under Vitest) and only the first of them has a
 * preload.
 *
 * **No token ever appears in any of these shapes.** `gh` holds its own credential in its
 * own store; this surface only ever learns account logins, hosts and scopes.
