/**
 * A panel the user decides the position of.
 *
 * Wrap a surface in one of these and it gains: a persisted placement of its own
 * (floating, or docked left, right, top or bottom), a chooser in its own title bar and a
 * keyboard path to it, a geometry that never covers the control that opened it, Escape to
 * close, focus moved in on opening and returned to the opener on closing, and the whole
 * per-element appearance feature on its chrome. The host supplies a title, a body and
 * optionally a row that sits under the title bar; everything else is here so that adding
 * a second docked surface cannot mean a second, subtly different implementation of any of
 * it.
 *
 * ## Not a dialog, in the sense that matters
 *
 * It paints its own surface and sits above the application, but it takes nothing hostage:
 * there is no scrim, the application behind stays visible and usable, and it carries
 * `role="dialog"` **without** `aria-modal`, which is exactly what a non-modal panel is.
 * That is also why it is not built on `v-dialog` or `v-overlay`: those are the components
 * this project reserves for a decision that must be made before continuing, and a panel
 * you can put wherever you like is not one.
 *
 * ## Learning what opened it
 *
 * The geometry needs the opener's rectangle. A host that has the element passes it; a host
 * that does not gets the element that had focus at the moment the surface opened, which
 * for a keyboard user is exactly right and for a mouse user is right whenever the button
 * took focus on click. When neither yields anything the surface simply has no opener to
 * clear, which is stated in the type as `null` rather than guessed at.
 *
 * Focus goes back to that element on close. Losing focus to `<body>` after closing a panel
 * is the most common way a keyboard user gets stranded, and it is invisible to anyone
 * testing with a mouse.

 * every ancestor up to the nearest bounded box is itself a flex container passing on a
 * real height - a plain block here breaks the chain two levels down: the host's own
 * `flex: 1 1 auto` has nothing to flex against, its height becomes "however tall the
 * content is" rather than "however tall the available space is", and the tab strip or
 * search header that was supposed to stay pinned while only the active tab's content
 * scrolls ends up scrolling away with everything else instead. `overflow: auto` stays
 * here too, as the outer safety net every docked surface keeps regardless of what its
 * host does with the space handed to it.
