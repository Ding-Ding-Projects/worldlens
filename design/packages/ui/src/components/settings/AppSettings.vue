/**
 * The settings surface a failed render points at.
 *
 * Four settings live here, and every one of them is the real control rather than a
 * label describing one. Consent is the existing `ConsentSettingsRow`, mounted, not
 * reimplemented — the same component the first-run flow's other end uses, so the record
 * it shows and the record a render reads are the same record. The storage folder is an
 * editable path validated by the same module first-run setup validates against. The two
 * that cannot be controls here say why in as many words: this build has no way to ask
 * about the Java runtime, and a world folder belongs to one map rather than to the app.
 *
 * The two sections underneath them are reached only by opening Settings, because no
 * `SettingsTarget` names either: GitHub sign-in, and the language mode with its two funny
 * levels. The language section mounts the same `SetupLanguagePanel` the first-run flow
 * shows rather than a second copy of it, so the three persisted keys have exactly one set
 * of controls writing them. Two panels writing the same keys would disagree the moment one
 * of them was opened second, and both would look right while doing it.
 *
 * **Every section is its own browser-style tab**, carried by the project's own
 * `TabbedNavigation` rather than one long scrolling column: an overflow surface when
 * the strip cannot fit them all, reordering, pinning, grouping, and a tab order that
 * survives a restart under its own storage key so this surface's layout never fights
 * the map shell's. Only the active tab's section is mounted at a time — the same rule
 * `TabbedNavigation` applies everywhere else — so the search above the strip does not
 * hide sections with `v-show` any more; it lists which sections match and jumps to the
 * one you pick, exactly the pattern the config editor's own cross-screen search already
 * uses.
 *
 * **Opening at an anchor reveals the setting.** It switches to that setting's tab,
 * scrolls it into view, focuses it, and outlines it briefly, because a render that
 * stopped and offered a link has promised a remedy; landing somebody on a settings
 * surface and leaving them to find the right tab is a hint. A leftover search query is
 * cleared on the way, because a stale query would show a match list over the tab that
 * was just switched to.
 *
 * **Not a modal.** It is a side sheet with no scrim: the application behind it stays
 * visible and usable, Escape closes it, and nothing about it halts anything. A blocking
 * dialog is reserved for a decision that genuinely must be made before continuing, and
 * changing a folder is not one.
 *
 * **Where it sits is the user's choice.** It was a right-hand drawer because somebody had
 * to pick one, which is fine on a wide display and wrong for anyone whose map is on the
 * right. `DockedSurface` gives it a persisted placement - floating, or docked to any of
 * the four edges - a chooser in its own title bar, and geometry that never covers the
 * button that opened it. The chrome, the Escape handling, the focus return and the
 * placement all live there rather than here, so the next docked panel is a wrapper rather
 * than a second implementation of any of it.
