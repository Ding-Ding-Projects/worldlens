/**
 * The shell-level theme choice: that it reads and writes the viewer's own stored record
 * (same key, same JSON encoding), that a choice made with no map open reaches the next
 * viewer to start - including one whose map never opted into `useCookies` and so loads
 * no stored settings of its own - and that a change made inside the in-map menu is
 * mirrored back out so it survives that viewer being torn down.
 *
 * The Vuetify half - `useBlueMapTheme` falling back to this module's `currentTheme` when
 * no app is running - is asserted through `currentTheme` itself here: that computed is
 * the exact value the bridge reads.
