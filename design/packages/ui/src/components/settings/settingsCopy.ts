/**
 * The words each section puts on screen, in one place.
 *
 * Not a style choice: the surface's search bar matches against a section's title, its
 * explanation and its current values, and copy that lives only inside a component is
 * copy the search cannot see. Two sections — the Java runtime and the world folder —
 * say most of what they have to say in prose rather than in a field, so a search for
 * "JAVA_HOME" or "world folder" would find nothing at all if the search and the
 * component each held their own copy of it.
 *
 * So the strings are resolved once, from the caller's `t`, and both the component that
 * renders them and the search that matches them read the same function. The `Translate`
 * shape is the one `world/worldFolder.ts` already uses for exactly this reason: a pure
 * function that takes the translator produces text that a Node test can assert on
 * without mounting anything.
