/**
 * The theme choice - follow the system, dark, light, or the high-contrast scheme -
 * reachable without a map.
 *
 * The viewer has always offered this, in its own settings menu, and that menu only
 * exists while a map is open: `SettingsMenu.vue` writes `app.appState.theme` and the
 * viewer persists it through `saveUserSettings()`. Somebody who has not rendered
 * anything yet - the exact person most likely to be setting the app up to their eyes -
 * had no theme control at all. This module gives the settings surface the same choice
 * against the same stored record, so the two controls can never disagree about what was
 * chosen.
 *
 * ## One record, two writers, one precedence rule
 *
 * The stored record is the viewer's own `bluemap-theme` localStorage entry, written
 * through the same JSON encoding `BlueMapApp.saveUserSetting` uses. While a viewer app
 * is live, its `appState.theme` is authoritative - it loaded that same record at
 * startup, and the in-map menu writes it - so this module's setter routes through
 * `app.setTheme()` and lets the viewer persist as it always has. With no app running,
 * the setter writes the record directly, and the next app to be created reads it back
 * through its own `loadUserSettings()`. `useBlueMapTheme` reads {@link currentTheme},
 * which resolves the same precedence, so the Vuetify chrome follows whichever writer
 * spoke last.
 *
 * `null` is a real choice, not an absence: it means "follow the system", exactly as it
 * does in the viewer.

 * that store itself.
 *
 * **A new viewer app gets the stored choice pushed into it.** The viewer only loads its
 * own persisted settings when the map's `settings.json` opts into `useCookies`, and the
 * fallback when a map ships no such file is `false` - so a freshly opened local map can
 * start at `theme: null` in the face of a stored "dark", and the whole window would snap
 * to the system scheme the moment a map loaded. Pushing is convergent rather than a
 * second opinion: where the viewer *does* load its settings, it reads the very record
 * this module writes, so both writers arrive at the same value in either order.
 *
 * **A change inside the same app is mirrored back out.** The in-map settings menu writes
 * `appState.theme`; mirroring it into {@link storedTheme} (and the stored record, which
 * the viewer only persists itself behind that same `useCookies` gate) is what keeps the
 * choice after the app is torn down on a profile switch, instead of snapping back to
 * whatever the record held when this module first loaded.
