 * The window is frameless, so this is the whole of the window chrome: the operating

 * all the way to the top edge instead of stopping under a grey strip drawn by somebody
 * else. It also means the three window buttons are this component's responsibility, and a
 * window with no way to close it is a window nobody can quit.
 *
 * **The drag region is the bar, minus the buttons.** `-webkit-app-region: drag` makes an
 * element move the window instead of receiving events, so every interactive thing in here
 * has to opt back out with `no-drag` - and anything that forgets becomes a control that
 * cannot be clicked, only dragged. The buttons and nothing else are marked.
 *
 * In a browser build the whole component renders nothing: `available` is false, there is
 * no window to minimise, and a close button on a web page that cannot close its own tab
 * is exactly the decorative-looking control this project forbids.
