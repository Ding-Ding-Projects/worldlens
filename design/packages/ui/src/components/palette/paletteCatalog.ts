/**
 * Everything the palette lists, assembled from the registries that already exist.
 *
 * The rule this file is built around is that the palette owns no list of its own. Every row
 * is derived from the registry that already describes the thing:
 *
 *  - the app's settings surface publishes `SETTINGS_SECTIONS` and `sectionCopy()`, so its
 *    five sections arrive here with the same titles and explanations they render with, in
 *    the current language, and a sixth section added there appears here on the same commit;
 *  - the options editor publishes `SCREENS`, so its seven tabs arrive with their own labels
 *    and descriptions;
 *  - the running viewer publishes its settings through `BlueMapApp` itself, which is where
 *    `viewerSettings.ts` reads and writes them.
 *
 * A hand-kept copy of any of those would be the list that falls behind, and the failure mode
 * is the one this whole feature exists to prevent: somebody types the name of a setting they
 * are looking at and is told it does not exist.
 *
 * **Teleporting reuses the shell's existing mechanism rather than inventing a second one.**
 * A render that stops for a fixable reason already names the setting that would fix it, the
 * shell already opens the settings surface at that anchor, and that surface already scrolls
 * the row into view, focuses it and outlines it for a moment. A destination row here emits
 * exactly the `SettingsTarget` that flow emits, so `App.vue` can hand it to the same
 * `revealSetting` it already has. There is one reveal path in this application and this adds
 * a second entrance to it, not a second path.
 *
 * **Where a teleport cannot land, the row says something smaller and true.** Two cases:
 * the GitHub section is not one of the four anchors the settings surface accepts, and the
 * options editor has no way to be opened at a chosen tab. Rather than seven rows that all
 * quietly open the same first tab - which is precisely the decorative control this project
 * keeps finding - the editor collapses to a single row carrying all seven tabs' words in its
 * searchable text, until the shell says it can route. `canRouteConfigScreens` is that
 * promise, and it defaults to false, so the honest behaviour is the one you get by default
 * and the richer one has to be switched on deliberately by whoever wired it up.
 *
 * **The shell's pages arrive from the shell, not from a list here.** This catalogue used to
 * know about three surfaces - Settings, the options editor and the server list - while the
 * application had grown a tab strip with seven pages on it. Five of them could not be reached
 * from the palette at all, which is the exact failure the feature exists to prevent: somebody
 * types "backups", the page is right there behind a tab, and the palette says nothing matches.
 * The fix is not a list of seven pages written here, because that list would fall behind the
 * strip the same way the old one did. `pages` is handed down from whoever owns the strip, so a
 * page added to it is in the palette on the same commit, and a page this file has never heard
 * of still gets a row - with a generic explanation rather than none. {@link PAGE_NOTES} adds
 * the sentence where one is known, and is allowed to be incomplete precisely because a missing
 * entry costs a good description rather than a whole destination.
 *
 * **The optional actions are how a shell says what it can do.** Everything after `openProfiles`
 * on {@link PaletteShellActions} is optional, and a row is built only for the ones a shell
 * actually passed. That is not defensive coding: the palette is mounted in tests and could be
 * mounted in a smaller host, and a row that emits into nothing would be the decorative control
 * this project keeps finding. A shell that wires them all gets the whole catalogue; one that
 * wires none gets exactly the rows it can honour.
