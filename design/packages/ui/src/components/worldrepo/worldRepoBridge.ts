/**
 * The seam between the "world kept in a git repository" surface and the main process.
 *
 * Every type here is a structural mirror of the one the Electron preload exposes on
 * `window.worldlens.worldRepo`, **restated rather than imported**, for the same reason
 * `pagesBridge.ts` and `backupBridge.ts` restate theirs: this package compiles and runs in
 * three places (inside the Electron shell, inside a plain browser tab, inside vitest) and
 * only the first of those has a preload. Importing across that boundary would also drag a
 * git driver, `node:fs` and a process spawner into the renderer's bundle, which is exactly
 * what the preload was split out to prevent.
 *
 * `main/worldrepo/ipc.ts` registers all eleven `worldrepo:*` channels unconditionally, so
 * unlike `PagesBridge` (which degrades method by method because the Pages feature grew a
 * preload gradually) this bridge is genuinely all-or-nothing: {@link resolveWorldRepoBridge}
 * returns `null` unless every one of them is present as a function.
 *
 * ## No credential crosses this, in either direction
 *
 * There is no token on any of these types and no channel that could carry one.
 * Authentication for both the API and the push is `gh`'s own credential store, held in the
 * main process's child processes and never read from here. When `gh` is signed out this
 * screen learns it from `WorldRepoPreflight.gh`, which names the command to run in a
 * terminal - `gh auth login` cannot be driven from inside an application at all.
