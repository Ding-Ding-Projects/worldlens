/**
 * A project, as plain functions over plain values.
 *
 * Everything that decides anything about a project lives here rather than in the
 * components, for the same reason `../world/wizardModel.ts` keeps the wizard's rules out
 * of its steps: the rules worth trusting are the ones a test can prove, and these are
 * exactly the sort that get quietly broken by a template change six months later.
 *
 * Three of them are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **the map id is previewed as it is typed, not validated after the fact.** The id
 *    becomes a folder on disk and a segment in the URL a tile is served from, so somebody
 *    typing `My World!` has to see `my-world-` while they are typing rather than meet it
 *    for the first time in a path. {@link previewMapId} is that preview and
 *    {@link mapIdProblem} is the refusal that follows it;
 *  - **a map's named fields and its config text are kept in step.** `name`, `dimension`,
 *    `sorting` and `storage` are real keys in `maps/<id>.conf` as well as fields on the
 *    project record. Writing one and not the other produces a project whose summary line
 *    disagrees with the file it would render from, which is the kind of divergence nobody
 *    notices until a render comes out wrong. {@link withMapIdentity} writes both;
 *  - **nothing here writes a file.** Every function returns a new {@link ProjectFile}, so
 *    the editor can hold an unsaved project, show what is dirty, and let somebody abandon
 *    it - and so all of this is testable with no disk anywhere near it.
 *
 * ## The two id rules, and why there are two
 *
 * `projectFileSchema` accepts `^[a-z0-9_-]+$`. The render engine is stricter: it refuses an
 * id outside `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$` before it writes anything, which is what
 * `../world/wizardModel.ts` validates against. An id that satisfies the schema and not the
 * engine would save happily and then fail at render time, which is the worst place to find
 * out. So the preview produces text that satisfies the schema, and the problem check
 * applies the engine's rule, on the field that asked for it.
