/**
 * The tabbed shell: one strip, one panel, and the state behind both.
 *
 * This is the component a shell mounts. It owns exactly one
 * {@link TabWorkspaceState}, hands it down to the strip, and applies every
 * change through the pure functions in `tabModel.ts`. Nothing below it holds a
 * copy of the order, which is why what is drawn, what is searched and what is
 * written to storage can never be three different things.
 *
 * ### Pages, and why a tab is not a page
 *
 * The host declares its pages and renders one named slot each; a tab names a
 * page. Two tabs may name the same page, which is the whole difference between
 * a tab strip and a switch statement, and it is why the label lives on the tab
 * rather than being looked up from the page every time something searches.
 *
 * Only the active page's slot is rendered. A hidden panel per tab would keep
 * every page alive, and one of this application's pages holds a map renderer.
 *
 * ### Restoring, and choosing not to
 *
 * The layout is read once at setup and written on every change. A file that is
 * missing, unreadable, from another version, or internally inconsistent gets
 * the same treatment: the defaults are seeded instead, one tab per declared
 * page. That is a deliberate choice over restoring half a layout, because half
 * a layout is indistinguishable from a bug and a fresh one is obviously a fresh
 * one.
 *
 * ### Seeding a default that is not a wall of tabs
 *
 * "One tab per declared page" is honest and, for a shell with twelve
 * destinations, unreadable: a newcomer meets twelve flat, equal-weight names
 * and has no way to tell the two they need from the nine they will need later.
 * {@link initialGroups} lets the host say which pages belong together and under
 * what name, and {@link seedStrip} builds that shape once - a short strip of
 * loose tabs and named, collapsed groups, with every destination one disclosure
 * away rather than removed.
 *
 * This changes nothing about a workspace that already exists. `seedStrip` runs
 * only where `readTabWorkspace` returned null, which is the same condition it
 * always ran under, so a returning user's own order, pins, groups and collapse
 * states are restored exactly as they left them and never re-shaped to match a
 * default they never saw. A seeded group is also an ordinary group from the
 * moment it exists: renaming, recolouring, reordering, ungrouping and deleting
 * it all work, and the result is what gets persisted.
 *
 * ### Revealing without un-collapsing
 *
 * `revealed` is the runtime set of groups a search result has opened. It is
 * never persisted and never written into the group's own `collapsed` field, so
 * following a result into a collapsed group leaves the user's saved preference
 * exactly as they left it - which the contract asks for in as many words.

            rendered: a hidden panel per tab would keep every page alive, and one
            of them owns a map renderer.

            The arrival is animated through `styles/motion.scss`'s `mb-page` class family -
            a short fade with a small rise on the decelerate curve, on the incoming panel
            only. Three things about this are deliberate:

             - `mode="out-in"` keeps the "only the active page is rendered" promise above
               literally true. The default mode overlaps the two, which would mount two
               pages - one of them the map - for as long as the leave takes;
             - there is no leave animation at all (no `.mb-page-leave-*` rule exists), so
               "as long as the leave takes" is one frame rather than a wait. Nothing is
               made unclickable and nothing is delayed by an animation;
             - the key is the *page*, not the tab. Two tabs may name the same page, and
               switching between them must not tear the page down and build it again -
               that would be a behaviour change wearing a transition's clothes. Switching
               to a different page already replaces the slot's whole subtree, so keying on
               it costs nothing.
