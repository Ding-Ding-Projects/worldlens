 * which the MD3 chrome does not read. Without this bridge the theme buttons would change
 * the marker colours and nothing else, which is exactly the "looks finished, does nothing"
 * failure. `null` means "follow the system", so we also track `prefers-color-scheme`.
 *
 * The chosen theme is `themeSetting.ts`'s `currentTheme`, whether or not a viewer is
 * running. This used to read `appState.theme` first while an app was live, on the stated
 * grounds that the two agreed by construction. They do not: the viewer writes that field
 * during its own startup with a value nobody chose, which is precisely the defect
 * `themeSetting.ts` documents at length. Reading the record means a viewer's startup can
 * no longer repaint the whole window on its way past, and a choice made before the first
 * map is ever rendered still reaches the chrome it was made for.
 *
 * The `_app` parameter is kept so the three callers do not have to change and so the
 * bridge still reads as belonging to a particular viewer; nothing about the theme is
 * read from it any more, which is the point.
