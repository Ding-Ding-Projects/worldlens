/**
 * How a brand-new workspace is arranged, and why it is not twelve flat tabs.
 *
 * Twelve equal-weight destinations is what every one of the pages above deserves and not
 * what a person meeting this application deserves: the two they need on the first day sit in
 * a list with nine they will need later and one they need when stuck, all in the same
 * typeface, all the same size, none of them explaining the others. That flat list is this
 * shell's single biggest source of "cluttered", and the answer is not to delete a
 * destination - every one of them is somebody's whole reason for opening the app - but to
 * say out loud which ones belong together, which is what the tab strip's own groups are for.
 *
 * So a fresh install seeds three named groups and leaves four things in front of them:
 *
 *  - **Home**, pinned by `pinned-page-ids` below and therefore outside every group, because
 *    the pinned region is what keeps the landing page at the front of the strip.
 *  - **Map** and **Make a map**, loose. They are the two things a newcomer actually does -
 *    look at a map, or make one - and putting either behind a disclosure would be answering
 *    "too much on screen" by hiding the part that is not too much.
 *  - **Docs**, loose. It is the destination somebody reaches for precisely when the rest of
 *    the strip has stopped making sense, and it is one tab: a group holding a single tab is
 *    a header that hides exactly one thing and saves exactly one row, which is an
 *    indirection charging rent it does not pay.
 *
 * The three groups are named for the job their members share, taken from what each page is
 * for rather than from where it happens to sit in the list above:
 *
 *  - **Rendering** - Projects, GitHub runners, Renders. Everything that decides how a render
 *    is set up and shows what it is doing: the settings a project carries, the fourth answer
 *    to "where does this render run", and the count of what is in flight.
 *  - **Finished maps** - Maps and servers, Publish to Pages, Watch it live. A map that
 *    already exists, and the three places it can be looked at: this application's own list
 *    of local and remote maps, somebody else's static host, and this computer serving it
 *    straight off its own disk.
 *  - **Keeping a copy** - Backups, World repository. The two ways a world or a render is put
 *    somewhere that is not this one machine: a versioned upload to GitHub, and a git
 *    repository a second computer can adopt.
 *
 * This is a default rather than a structure. Every group here can be renamed, recoloured,
 * reordered, emptied or ungrouped from the moment the strip is drawn, and that choice is what
 * gets persisted; nothing re-applies this list to a workspace that already exists, which is
 * the whole reason it is passed as a seed rather than enforced on every mount. A returning
 * user's strip is exactly the one they arranged, groups and all.
 *
 * ## They are seeded open, and that is deliberate
 *
 * The first version of this seeded them collapsed, on the reasoning that the shortest
 * possible strip is the least cluttered one. It is, and it costs more than it saves. What
 * makes twelve flat tabs hard to read is that nothing says which of them belong together,
 * and a name over a group fixes that on its own - the reader's eye gets three labelled
 * regions instead of one undifferentiated list, whether or not the members are showing.
 * Collapsing on top of that does not remove clutter so much as remove *destinations*: every
 * page below a header becomes a thing you must already know is there to go looking for, and
 * the strip stops being able to answer "what can this application do" by being looked at.
 *
 * There is a concrete cost too, and it is the kind that is easy to miss from a wide window.
 * A disclosure is a control, and a control is something that can fail to be pressed - by
 * automation, by an assistive technology driving the strip, or by anyone on a short window
 * where the header itself is what scrolled out of reach. Reachability that depends on a
 * click is strictly weaker than reachability that does not, and the capture harness proved
 * it: with the groups seeded shut, five destinations became unreachable to it, on a strip
 * whose own diagnostics reported every group present, named and correct.
 *
 * Open by default, then. The grouping does the de-cluttering, the strip stays honest about
 * what the application contains, and collapsing is left as what it always should have been:
 * something the reader does to the sections they have decided they do not need.
 */
