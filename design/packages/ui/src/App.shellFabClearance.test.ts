/**
 * The CSS half of "the bottom-left utility FABs do not paint over page content" - the half
 * a mounted test cannot see.
 *
 * `App.test.ts` proves `.mb-world-host` is the element every page (World, Projects,
 * CI-render, Servers, Backups, Pages, Docs, and the options editor) is mounted inside; it
 * cannot prove that host reserves real clearance for `.mb-shell-fabs`, because jsdom
 * computes no layout at all - `getComputedStyle` there never reflects a single rule from
 * any `<style>` block regardless of whether it is right. This is the same "read the
 * source, not a stand-in" idiom `components/settings/dockScrollChain.test.ts` and
 * `components/confirm/superConfirmPolicy.test.ts` use for the same reason.
 *
 * A visual audit of the current screenshot set (`docs/visual-audit-2026-08-05.md`) found
 * the FAB stack (four buttons at the time; the licence and welcome buttons have since
 * moved out, leaving Settings and the options editor), which is `position: fixed` at the
 * bottom-left, painting directly over scrolled-to text in nine separate screenshots
 * across six surfaces - "Rendering" reading "ndering", "Pick an account" reading "ck an
 * account", and at higher display scales the icons sitting on top of actual radio-button
 * controls. The fix reserves a permanent left gutter on `.mb-world-host` sized to the
 * stack's own footprint - a footprint set by the buttons' shared width, not their count,
 * so it holds for two buttons exactly as it did for four; this file pins the two numbers
 * together so a future edit to either cannot silently reopen the gap between them.
 *
 * ## The reported "ninth instance" was the eighth one, seen through a doorway
 *
 * A later handoff flagged `docs/screenshots/settings-drawer.png` as a ninth instance
 * living inside the Settings drawer's own scroll region (`DockedSurface.vue`'s
 * `.mb-docked__body`), distinct from the eight `.mb-world-host` pages this file already
 * covers. Re-checked against the current tree, that is not where the cropped text comes
 * from: `settings-drawer.png` is captured by clicking the Settings FAB while the Backups
 * tab is still the active page underneath it (`screenshots.spec.ts`'s "captures the
 * settings surface" test runs immediately after "captures the backup screen" without
 * switching tabs), and "Choose the world or folder to back up before this can start." is
 * `BackupScreen.vue`'s own copy (`copy/surfaces/backup.ts`'s `backup.blocked.source`),
 * not anything `AppSettings.vue` or `DockedSurface.vue` renders - `worldFolderCopy()`, the
 * only settings-drawer copy that mentions a world folder, says something else entirely.
 * The drawer is docked to the right by default, so the Backups page's text visible to its
 * left is exactly the eighth, already-covered instance, not a new one.
 *
 * Whether a *docked-left, docked-bottom, or floating* placement could still trap the
 * drawer's own content under the stack turns out to be answered by `.mb-docked`'s
 * `z-index: 1500` below: confirmed against a real layout engine (Chromium, via
 * Playwright, the same idiom `components/settings/dockScrollChain.test.ts` and
 * `2b04a82`'s docked-panel fix used) with the two rulesets below transplanted verbatim
 * into a bare page, `document.elementFromPoint` at the FAB's own centre - and at that
 * point after scrolling arbitrary filler content underneath it - always resolves to the
 * docked panel, never the FAB, in every placement that covers that corner at all. A
 * docked surface's own explicit stacking level already wins; padding wired to the same
 * 76px is not needed and would just narrow it for no reason. The second `describe` below
 * pins both halves of the ordering that makes this true, so it stays true rather than
 * staying true by accident.

/**
 * The other half of "these buttons do not paint over anything", found the same way the

 *
 * The clearance above is about page *content*. This is about the strip. The stack is fixed
 * to the bottom-left corner, which was empty while the strip ran along the top of the
 * window - but the strip's default placement is the left edge, so that corner is the
 * strip's own. `diagnostic-pages-publishing-screen.png` from a real harness run shows the
 * configuration button drawn on top of the strip's overflow and search controls, and the
 * run itself failed on a click the button had intercepted rather than on anything wrong
 * with the tab.
 *
 * The fix is the pattern `AppTitleBar.vue` already uses for `--mb-titlebar-height`:
 * `TabStrip.vue` measures its own width and publishes it, and this stack offsets by it.
 * Measured rather than hard-coded because the strip is as wide as its widest label needs,
 * the user can move it to any of four edges, and it is `0px` for the three placements that
 * leave the left edge alone.
