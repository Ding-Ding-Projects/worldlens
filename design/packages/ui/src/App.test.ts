 * nobody can open, so these assertions start where a user starts - at a tab or a button in the
 * corner - and go through the rendered DOM rather than through the component's internals.
 *
 * Three things are checked that only a mounted shell can answer: that Escape gives the focus
 * back to the button that opened the surface, that exactly one notification corner is on
 * screen, and that a feature reachable from two places does not end up with two competing ways
 * in. All three are invisible to a test that pokes at state.

/**
 * Every case in this file mounts the whole shell, and the whole shell is the single most
 * expensive thing this workspace's jsdom suite mounts - a title bar, eleven tab pages'
 * worth of wiring, the appearance system, the command palette, first-run setup and the
 * notification corner, all real components rather than stand-ins. The workspace default of
 * 30s (see `vitest.config.ts`) is nowhere near that on a developer machine - every test here
 * runs in under a second and a half in isolation - but it was measured too close on the
 * self-hosted CI runner this project moved onto, and measurement rather than a doubled
 * guess is what earns this file its own number:
 *
 *   - CI run 31074156612 (commit be82630) failed exactly two of this file's 34 tests, both
 *     with `Error: Test timed out in 30000ms`: "the notification corner > is mounted once
 *     by the shell..." (`App.test.ts:717`) at 43561ms elapsed, and "...shows a message
 *     raised while nothing is open" (`App.test.ts:730`) at 36517ms - the process itself
 *     did not even notice the 30s mark until well past it, which is contention delaying
 *     the timeout's own report, not a test quietly doing 43 seconds of real work.
 *   - The whole file is the tell: that same run logged
 *     `App.test.ts (34 tests | 2 failed) 146739ms` - about 3.3x a clean local run of this
 *     exact file alone (44.37s wall, 24.58s of that in tests). Every other test here mounts
 *     the identical shell and stayed under 30s only by margin, not because it is cheaper.
 *   - It is not this file, or App.vue, getting slower to start: `ProjectEditor.test.ts`, a
 *     comparably heavy jsdom-mount file elsewhere in this package, took 119199ms in that
 *     same CI run against 27.99s run alone locally - roughly the same ~4x factor - while
 *     running concurrently with this file in the other of `vitest.config.ts`'s two pinned
 *     forks. A `TabGroupPicker.typecheck.test.ts` in the same run spent 53941ms shelling
 *     out to `vue-tsc` in that same two-fork pool. Profiling `App.vue`'s own mount path
 *     found nothing eager to blame either: `renderIndicator.reconcile()`, wired in
 *     `onMounted`, resolves near-instantly the moment `window.worldlens` is
 *     undefined (true for every test in this file), and `HomeScreen` - the page the shell
 *     opens on by default - has no eager work of its own. Measured here: 952ms and 563ms
 *     mounting alone, 972ms and 606ms mounting early inside a full, two-fork-pinned run of
 *     this workspace's entire 9,329-test suite. The shell is not the regression; the
 *     runner's shared two-process pool getting oversubscribed by other files' real work is.
 *
 * 60s (this codebase's own convention for known-slow, real-world work - see the several
 * `{ timeout: 60_000 }` "on a real disk" describes in `packages/app`) leaves comfortable
 * room above the worst measured 43.5s without pretending a genuine hang would go unnoticed.
