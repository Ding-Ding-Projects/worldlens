/**
 * Mirroring one settings surface's own preference into the main process's shared
 * application-settings history.
 *
 * `main/settings/store.ts` holds every wired surface's current value in one flat `values`
 * bag, keyed by whatever name the surface gives itself - see that file's own doc comment.
 * `writeAppSettingsState` replaces the whole file with whatever it is handed, so a surface
 * that saved only its own key would silently erase every other surface's already-recorded
 * value the next time this ran. {@link recordAppSetting} exists specifically to not do
 * that: it reads the bag that is there now, merges this one key into it, and saves the
 * merge - never the surface's own value alone.
 *
 * ## Fire-and-forget, exactly like `stores/profiles.ts`'s own mirror
 *
 * `localStorage` stays each surface's real source of truth for this task - see
 * `docs/config-history.md`'s own staged migration plan, which this file is step 2 of and
 * step 3 (reading the history back as the source of truth) deliberately does not attempt.
 * A history write that fails, or a build with no bridge at all (a browser tab, most tests),
 * must never turn a settings change into a thrown error, so every rejection here is
 * swallowed and every absent bridge method answers null rather than throwing.
 *
 * ## The read-then-write is not atomic, and that is a known, accepted limit
 *
 * Two surfaces changing within the same tick could both read the bag before either writes
 * it back, and the second write would not see the first's key. Nothing is lost by that: the
 * next time either surface changes again, its own next call reads the by-then-current bag
 * and the missed key reappears from the merge. This mirror is a best-effort backup on top
 * of `localStorage`, not the thing anyone's settings actually depend on staying correct
 * moment to moment - only `localStorage` is.
 *
 * ## Every `localStorage`-backed store is either wired here, or excluded here by name
 *
 * `docs/config-history.md` names every `worldlens-*` preference this package keeps.
 * Each one now does exactly one of two things, and {@link APP_SETTINGS_HISTORY_KEYS} plus
 * {@link EXCLUDED_APP_SETTINGS} are the audit trail for which: a store either calls
 * {@link recordAppSetting} from wherever it already writes `localStorage`, under the key
 * listed in {@link APP_SETTINGS_HISTORY_KEYS}, or it is named in
 * {@link EXCLUDED_APP_SETTINGS} with a reason a reviewer can check against the code. A store
 * that does neither is a silent gap, which is exactly what this pair of lists exists to
 * make impossible to have by accident - `appSettingsHistorySync.test.ts` asserts both lists
 * against the real call sites.
 *
 * `profiles.ts` and the maps-and-servers list it backs are deliberately not on either list:
 * they already have their own dedicated history channel, `profilesHistory`, wired directly
 * in `stores/profiles.ts` - a second, weaker mirror through this generic bag would not add
 * anything `profilesHistory` does not already keep.
