/**
 * Turning one autosave attempt into, at most, one non-blocking notice.
 *
 * `main/project/autosave.ts` reports every attempt it makes - automatic or flushed,
 * successful or not - and it is tempting to raise an alert for each one, because that is the
 * most direct way to answer "is my work being saved". It is also exactly the noise the
 * project's non-blocking-notification rules warn against: an editor open for ten minutes
 * autosaves several times on its own quiet interval alone, and an alert on every one of them
 * would make the feature hated rather than trusted within the first session anyone used it.
 *
 * So the policy here is deliberately narrow, and it is a pure function precisely so the
 * policy itself - not the wiring around it - is what gets tested:
 *
 *   - A **successful, routine** autosave (`reason: "quiet"`, `ok: true`, `historyOk: true`)
 *     raises nothing at all. The project's own History tab is the ambient indicator that
 *     work is being kept; it already lists every revision with what changed and when, which
 *     is a truer "your work is safe" than a repeated alert that says the same four words every
 *     fifteen seconds.
 *   - A **flushed but still routine** save (`reason: "boundary" | "destructive" | "quit"`)
 *     is treated the same as `"quiet"` when it succeeds - it is still an autosave, not
 *     something the person asked for by name, and it deserves the same quiet.
 *   - Any **failure** - the write itself failing, or the write succeeding with no record of
 *     it kept - always raises a notice, at every reason, because a broken safety net is
 *     exactly the kind of thing the notification rules call out as deserving attention
 *     rather than silence.
 *
 * Failures share one notice category with a cooldown, via `stores/notices.ts`'s `notify`, so
 * a repository that starts failing every autosave for the next few minutes interrupts once
 * and then stops interrupting - the failure stays fully reviewable in the notification
 * centre's history the whole time, it just stops elbowing its way onto the unread badge.
