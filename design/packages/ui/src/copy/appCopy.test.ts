/**
 * The catalogue's own integrity, checked against the source that consumes it.
 *
 * `appCopy.ts` is three hundred and thirty strings of prose in two languages, and prose is
 * exactly the kind of thing that passes review and is wrong. The failures this file is
 * built to catch are the ones that look fine in a diff:
 *
 *  - a level that drops a `{placeholder}`, so the path, the count or the map id renders as
 *    nothing and the sentence still reads like a sentence;
 *  - a level that invents a placeholder the call site never passes, which vue-i18n renders
 *    as empty for the same reason and with the same silence;
 *  - a playful rewrite that stops saying the delete cannot be undone, or that the
 *    already-rendered tiles are not deleted, or that a value is kept out of the logs;
 *  - five "levels" that are five copies of one string, so a slider that is wired to nothing
 *    still looks wired.
 *
 * The placeholder checks read the *call sites*, not a hand-written list. The English
 * fallback in the third argument of `t()` is the definition of which values that key is
 * given, so it is the only honest source of truth for what a translation of it must keep.
