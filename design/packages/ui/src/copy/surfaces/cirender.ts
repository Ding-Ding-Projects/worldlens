/**
 * The GitHub runners screen: rendering a world on GitHub Actions instead of on this
 * computer, and everything that has to be true before a byte of it leaves the machine.
 *
 * The surface is unusual for this application in that almost nothing it reports is under
 * its own control. It uploads a world to somebody else's storage, asks somebody else's
 * runners to render it, and then watches. Three consequences run through every string
 * below and are worth stating once here rather than in a comment above each of them.
 *
 * ## A run's state is never rounded up
 *
 * `run.going` and `run.ended` interpolate GitHub's own `status` and `conclusion` words.
 * They are not translated, not tidied, and not summarised into "working" and "done":
 * `queued`, `in_progress`, `failure`, `cancelled` and `timed_out` are what the GitHub API
 * says and what the run page will say when the reader opens it. A level that turned
 * `conclusion: failure` into a cheerful "all wrapped up" would be lying about somebody
 * else's machine, which is the one thing this screen cannot afford to do.
 *
 * ## "Recorded" and "verified" are different words
 *
 * `cirender.recorded` exists because GitHub does not publish a checksum for every
 * artifact. When it does not, this application hashes what it downloaded and stores that
 * hash, which proves the file has not changed since; it does not prove the file is the one
 * the run built. Every level of that entry keeps both halves, and `SHA-256` stays spelled
 * exactly that way in Cantonese too.
 *
 * ## Two GitHub sign-ins, and the screen always says which one
 *
 * There is the application's own OAuth sign-in and there is the `gh` command-line tool,
 * and they fail independently: one can read a private repository the other cannot, and
 * either can be the credential that ends up doing the upload. `gh.*`, `route.other`,
 * `repository.unknown` and `repository.fallback` all name which of the two they are
 * talking about, at every level, because "signing in to GitHub" is not an instruction
 * somebody can act on when there are two places to do it.
