/**
 * The downloads screen: a release's assets, the rows that fetch them, and the ten endings
 * a fetch can have.
 *
 * The subject matter decides the register here more than anywhere else in the catalogue.
 * A release of this project carries worlds past GitHub's two-gigabyte asset cap, so they
 * arrive as 1.7 GB parts with a SHA-256 for each, and a download is tens of minutes of
 * work with four phases and real byte counts. Every one of those numbers is a fact a
 * playful rewrite is tempted to round off, and rounding any of them off produces a screen
 * that reads well and cannot be acted on.
 *
 * Three groups of facts are pinned in `DOWNLOADS_FACTS` and never move:
 *
 *  - **What survived.** Stopping, a dropped connection and a crash all keep the bytes
 *    already on disk, and every level says so, because the difference between "carries on"
 *    and "starts again" is twenty minutes of somebody's evening.
 *  - **What was deleted.** `downloads.fail.integrity` is the one failure where something
 *    was thrown away on purpose, and it reads as a failed download at every level. A
 *    corrupt file that looks complete is the worst outcome on this screen, so no level
 *    softens it into a retry suggestion.
 *  - **Where the file is.** Paths, archive names and folder names are identifiers and are
 *    identical in both languages. A translated path sends the reader looking for a file
 *    that does not exist.
 *
 * `downloads.listFailed` is deliberately not here. It lives in `appCopy.ts` already, and
 * a second copy of a key is a merge conflict with two right answers.
