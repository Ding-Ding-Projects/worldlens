/**
 * The interactive tour: what each step says, and the buttons around it.
 *
 * Every fact in here was checked against the running application rather than assumed:
 * `finding-worlds.md` for the automatic default-folder scan, `RenderProgressDetail.vue` for
 * there being no fixed render time and the percentage-then-estimate behaviour, `pages.pitch`
 * in `copy/appCopy.ts` for what publishing actually changes, and `palettePrefs.ts` for the
 * command palette's real shortcut, Control+Shift+F. Nothing here promises a feature the app
 * does not have or describes a flow that has since changed; where a step is genuinely just
 * "point BlueMap at a world, answer a few short steps", that is `world.screen.blurb`'s own
 * wording, not an invention for this file.
 *
 * Two of the seven steps say where the map lives, and where it lives changed: the Material
 * Design 3 shell rewrite moved Home and Map off the tab strip and onto the application rail,
 * so `welcome` and `openMap` name the rail's Map button rather than a Map tab, at every level
 * and in both languages. Their anchors in `tutorialSteps.ts` were moved to `rail-map` in that
 * rewrite while these sentences were left behind, which put the highlight on the rail and the
 * words on a tab that no longer exists - the one failure a tour anchored to real controls is
 * supposed to be immune to, since the user can see both at once. `makeAMap` and `publish` still
 * say "this tab" because the world wizard and the publishing screen genuinely are still tabs in
 * the strip, and rewording them to match their neighbours would introduce the same defect in
 * the opposite direction.
 *
 * `tutorial.step.*.title` and the control labels are `FIXED`: short, and a funny level
 * restyling "Next" or "Back" would make a button somebody has to re-read mid-click. The step
 * bodies, the progress line and the one-time invitation are `VOICED`, because they are real
 * sentences a newcomer reads once, and `FACTS` pins the one concrete claim each of them makes
 * so a playful level cannot quietly drop it - see `copy/appCopy.ts`'s own header for why that
 * split exists.
