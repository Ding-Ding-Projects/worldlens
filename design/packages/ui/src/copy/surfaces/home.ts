/**
 * Home's own words: the tab label, its one-line "what BlueMap is" lede, its search chrome,
 * its section headings, and the one disabled-state sentence Backups and Publish to Pages
 * share.
 *
 * Deliberately short. Every tile that mirrors an existing page or shell surface - Make a
 * map, Settings, the options editor, the notification centre and a dozen more - reads its
 * title and description from the catalogue entry that surface already voices (`palette.*`,
 * `docsViewer.lede`, `tabs.page.*`), per `HomeScreen.vue`'s own doc comment on why. Nothing
 * here duplicates one of those; this module is only the words that belong to Home and to no
 * other surface.
 *
 * `tabs.page.home` lives here rather than beside its seven siblings in `chrome.ts`, because
 * that file was not this feature's to edit while a sibling workflow was touching unrelated
 * parts of the tree at the same time this was written. A future pass is free to move it;
 * nothing about where a key is registered changes what it resolves to.
