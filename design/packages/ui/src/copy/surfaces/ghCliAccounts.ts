/**
 * The `gh` command-line tool's own accounts: a second, separate list beside this
 * application's own multi-account GitHub sign-in (`accounts.ts` next door), for the account
 * `gh` itself is signed in as - shared by every terminal, script and other tool on this
 * computer, not managed by this application at all.
 *
 * ## The one distinction every string here exists to keep clear
 *
 * `gh`'s account store and this application's own are two different things that can
 * disagree at any moment. Nothing in this surface's copy may read as though they are one
 * list - `settings.github.ghCli.explainer` says so in as many words, at every funny level,
 * and it is one of the strings `GHCLIACCOUNTS_FACTS` pins hardest.
 *
 * ## The main process's own words travel through unchanged
 *
 * `main/ghcli/accounts.ts` already writes a complete, honest sentence for every state
 * (`gh` not installed, installed with nobody signed in, an unrecognised answer, how many
 * accounts are signed in) and for a switch's real outcome - including the machine-wide
 * disclosure requirement 3 asks for. Rewriting that prose per funny level here would be a
 * second place for the same fact to drift from the first, so every one of those messages
 * arrives as a `{reason}`/`{message}` placeholder inside a voiced shell, exactly the pattern
 * `settings.github.accounts.refreshFailed` next door already uses for the same reason: "the
 * main process's own reasons stay identical in both languages, because a translated one
 * sends the reader looking for something that does not exist." The literal word `gh` is
 * pinned into every level of those shells for the same reason a login or a scope name is
 * never touched - it is the product's own name, not prose to translate.
 *
 * ## The switch warning may never disappear
 *
 * `settings.github.ghCli.switchWarning` is shown beside the Switch action itself, before it
 * is pressed - not only after - because `gh auth switch` changes the active account for
 * every terminal, script and other tool on this computer, not only this application.
 * `GHCLIACCOUNTS_FACTS` pins "whole computer" (and its Cantonese equivalent) into every
 * level of that one key specifically so a rewrite can never quietly soften it away.
