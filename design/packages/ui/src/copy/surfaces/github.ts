/**
 * The GitHub account screen: the status row, the device-flow panel, the personal access
 * token form, and the sign-out confirmation.
 *
 * One module per surface, spread into `appCopy.ts`. The split is not cosmetic: the
 * catalogue is the one file in this package that several people edit at once, and a single
 * two-thousand-entry object literal makes every one of those edits touch the same hunk.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately *not* here
 *
 * `settings.github.title` and `settings.github.tokenScopes` are written directly in
 * `appCopy.ts`, and `settings.github.description`, `.whatFor`, `.signedOut` and
 * `.unsupported` belong to `surfaces/settings.ts`, which is the screen that introduces this
 * one. They are all `settings.github.*` and none of them belongs here; an entry here would
 * be shadowed anyway, because `appCopy.ts` spreads the surface modules before its own
 * entries.
 *
 * ## The one rule this surface adds
 *
 * Every string here is within reach of a credential, so none of them ever quotes one. No
 * level says how long a token is, what it starts with, or what was typed: a refusal names
 * what was wrong with the token (unknown to GitHub, missing a permission) and stops there,
 * so nothing that could reach a screenshot, a notice or a bug report carries a secret. The
 * device code is the one value shown on purpose, because it is a short-lived pairing string
 * that is worthless without the account holder approving it in their own browser.
 *
 * Two distinctions carry real consequences and are pinned as facts at every level:
 *
 *  - **revoked versus deleted.** `settings.github.revoked` is GitHub confirming the token
 *    is dead everywhere. `settings.github.notRevoked` is the token being gone from this
 *    computer with no such confirmation, so the grant may still be listed on the account.
 *    Rounding the second up to the first tells somebody they are safe when they are not.
 *  - **signed in versus signed in without a scope.** `settings.github.missingScopes` and
 *    `settings.github.tokenMissingScopes` both name the exact scope strings, because
 *    "something went wrong with permissions" is not something anybody can act on.
 *
 * Scope names, account names and GitHub's own error text stay identical in both languages
 * for the same reason a filename does: a translated `read:org` sends the reader looking for
 * a permission that does not exist.
