/**
 * The backups screen: choosing what to back up, choosing where it goes, watching one
 * happen, and reading the list of the ones a repository already holds.
 *
 * This surface is the consequence-heavy one in the catalogue, and the funny levels are held
 * tighter here than anywhere else because of two facts about what it does.
 *
 * **A backup is only as good as the thing that proves it came back whole.** Every part
 * carries its own SHA-256 in a pointer file beside it, and every sentence that mentions a
 * restore says so. `backup.listings.incompleteDetail` is the sharp end of that: the parts
 * are up there and the pointer is not, which means there is nothing to verify a restore
 * against. No level is allowed to round that up to "finished" or down to "broken". It is
 * exactly what it says: unverifiable, and resumable.
 *
 * **A backup goes somewhere, and where can be public.** `backup.blocked.public` and
 * `backup.acknowledgePublic` are the pair that stands between a world full of somebody's
 * builds and the whole internet, so PUBLIC stays shouted and "anybody" stays in the
 * sentence at every level, in both languages.
 *
 * ## Two near-duplicate pairs that are deliberately near-duplicates
 *
 * `backup.blocked.write` and `backup.readOnly` say the same refusal in two places: the
 * first is the one line under a greyed-out button explaining which of six gates is shut,
 * the second is the alert beside the repository that was just read. They are worded
 * differently on purpose, so that seeing both at once does not read as the app repeating
 * itself. Likewise `backup.row.failed` and `backup.listings.incomplete` are both "Did not
 * finish", because from the reader's side they are the same news about two different
 * objects: a run that stopped, and a release that never got its pointer.
 *
 * `backup.restoreHandoff` is *not* here. It belongs to `chrome.ts`, because it is what the
 * shell says after it has moved the reader to the Downloads surface, not what this screen
 * says.
 *
 * ## `backup.repo.*` and `backup.createRepo.*`: choosing a repository, or making one
 *
 * `backup.repo.none` and `backup.repo.noMatch` are two different empty states and read
 * differently on purpose: the first is the account itself having nothing yet, the second
 * is the account having plenty and this search finding none of it. `backup.repo.loadedSummary`
 * and `backup.repo.searchSummary` are the honest-pagination pair - `listWritableRepositories`
 * in the main process hands over up to 300 repositories, most recently active first, and
 * "up to 300" survives every level so a bounded page is never presented as the whole account.
 *
 * `backup.createRepo.visibility.publicNote` and `.privateNote` state the real trade-off at
 * this call site: PUBLIC means anybody can download whatever is backed up, and PRIVATE draws
 * down the repository-count limit of the plan it is created under. That is *not* the same
 * trade-off `cirender.caveats` states for the CI-render screen - GitHub Actions minutes are a
 * render-screen fact, because that screen runs a workflow and this one never does. Do not
 * import that sentence here; it would be a figure this surface has no call site for.
