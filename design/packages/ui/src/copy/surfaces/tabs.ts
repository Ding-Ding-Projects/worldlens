/**
 * The browser-style tab strip: the strip itself and its overflow surface, tab and group
 * context menus, the four tab-discovery searches, and every part of the bulk close that
 * runs before a tab actually goes.
 *
 * ## The one thing this module exists to get right
 *
 * A bulk close is the only place in the tab strip where a sentence can cost somebody
 * their work. Three facts therefore survive every funny level in both languages, and the
 * `FACTS` table at the bottom pins each of them:
 *
 *   - the **count**, and which count it is. `tabs.close.count` says how many of the
 *     eligible tabs would close, not how many exist; `tabs.close.gateAction` says how many
 *     close the moment the gate completes. Neither may round.
 *   - **who is excluded and why**. Pinned tabs are protected, tabs holding unsaved work
 *     stay open unless the user deliberately included them, and both exclusions are named
 *     rather than implied.
 *   - **that closing cannot be undone from here**, which is the sentence a playful level
 *     is most tempted to trade for a joke.
 *
 * ## The inverse pair
 *
 * `tabs.close.containing` and `tabs.close.notContaining` are exact inverses of one
 * predicate, and a reader who confuses them closes precisely the forty tabs they meant to
 * keep. They are FIXED so neither can drift under somebody, and the Cantonese uses two
 * visibly different words (含有 against 缺少) rather than the same phrase with a 唔 bolted
 * on, because a one-character difference is not a difference at a glance.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately *not* here
 *
 * `tabs.close.done`, `tabs.group.newName` and the `tabs.page.*` names live in `chrome.ts`.
 * `tabs.close.done` in particular is raised by the EULA reader as well as by this strip,
 * so it sits beside `eula.close.documentIntact`, the sentence it is always paired with.

     * languages because the keys on the keyboard are.
