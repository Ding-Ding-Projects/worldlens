/**
 * The Projects screen's copy: `ProjectEditor.vue`, `ProjectList.vue`, `ProjectMapsPanel.vue`,
 * `ProjectStoragesPanel.vue` and `ProjectsScreen.vue` in full.
 *
 * The project editor's destructive notes started this file: removing a map removes its
 * configuration while leaving already-rendered tiles behind, and removing a storage leaves
 * its tiles behind while maps may still point at it. Every level keeps those facts intact
 * while allowing the surrounding voice to change. The bulk-delete and single-delete warnings
 * in `ProjectList.vue`, the per-map and per-storage delete gates in `ProjectMapsPanel.vue`
 * and `ProjectStoragesPanel.vue`, and the world-forget flow in `ProjectsScreen.vue` are all
 * the same kind of note, restated for whichever thing is actually leaving: the world is
 * untouched, the tiles already rendered stay put, and every setting the removed thing held
 * goes with it.
 *
 * ## Almost the whole surface, `.vue` files and the model underneath
 *
 * Every literal `t(...)` call site in the five `.vue` files under `components/project`
 * resolves in this catalogue, and so does `projectModel.ts`'s `project.row.*` cluster (the
 * list row's secondary line - "world {world}", "{maps} maps", "last edited {at}", and so
 * on), even though that file is not a component: 202 of 204 real call sites, all voiced.
 * `components/project` still stays off `COVERED_SURFACES` in `catalogueCoverage.test.ts`
 * because of the two that are left, both in `ProjectList.vue`'s row menu.
 *
 * ## Keys deliberately left out
 *
 * A handful of call sites across the five `.vue` files cannot be answered here at all, and
 * are skipped rather than worked around:
 *
 *   - `t(`project.editor.tab.${kind}`, ...)` in `ProjectEditor.vue` builds its key from a
 *     template literal, so there is no literal call site for `appCopy.test.ts` to match a
 *     catalogue entry against. Voicing `project.editor.tab.core` would make that entry an
 *     orphan.
 *   - `t(problem.key, problem.vars ?? {}, problem.fallback)` appears three times with the
 *     same shape: in `ProjectMapsPanel.vue` for a map id and a storage id, in
 *     `ProjectStoragesPanel.vue` for a storage id, and in `ProjectsScreen.vue` for
 *     `renderProblems(project)[0]` before a render starts. All three read `problem.key` off
 *     an `IdProblem` (or the render-problem equivalent) that `projectModel.ts` builds as
 *     plain data - `project.map.needId`, `project.map.badId`, `project.storage.idTaken`,
 *     `project.render.noMaps`, `project.render.noneEnabled`, `project.render.credentialled`,
 *     and their kin. The strings exist in `projectModel.ts`, but never behind a literal
 *     `t("...")` call, so there is nothing for the coverage scanner to find and nothing here
 *     can answer them without going red.
 *   - `t("project.list.key.open", keyLabel(ROW_OPEN_KEY))` in `ProjectList.vue` passes a
 *     computed keyboard-key name as its second argument rather than a literal fallback
 *     string, and the value it renders (`Enter`, `Space`) is a keyboard label rather than
 *     prose to translate.
