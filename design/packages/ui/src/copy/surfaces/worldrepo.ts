/**
 * Keeping a Minecraft world in a git repository, and recognising a repository this
 * application already prepared on a computer that has never touched it before.
 *
 * Two features, one surface, one catalogue module - see `components/worldrepo/worldRepo.ts`'s
 * own doc comment for why the sync half and the adoption half stay structurally separate even
 * though they share a screen. `WORLDREPO_VOICED` carries the real prose: the pitch, the
 * blockers, the notices a sync or an adoption raises, and the empty states. Everything else -
 * field labels, section titles, phase names, button captions, aria-only labels - is a single
 * string per language in `WORLDREPO_FIXED`, because a funny level cannot usefully restyle
 * "Repository name" and a label that moved under somebody is a label they re-read every time.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT here
 *
 * `WorldRepoPreflight.blockers`/`.warnings`, an `AdoptionSignal.message`, an `AdoptionPlan`'s
 * `message`/`restoring`/`needsAttention[].message` - every one of those is a sentence
 * `main/worldrepo/repo.ts` or `main/worldrepo/adopt.ts` already composed in the main process,
 * rendered verbatim in `WorldRepoScreen.vue` rather than passed through `t()`. Voicing them
 * here would mean either overriding what the main process actually decided (the exact
 * mistake `catalogueCoverage.test.ts`'s own doc comment warns against for upstream's viewer
 * keys) or duplicating logic that already lives in one place. Only copy this screen itself
 * authors is catalogued.
