/**
 * The application chrome: the tab strip's page names, the window buttons, the zoom and
 * free-flight controls, the render progress readout, the notification centre, and the EULA
 * reader.
 *
 * One module per surface, spread into `appCopy.ts`. The split is not cosmetic: the
 * catalogue is the one file in this package that several people edit at once, and a single
 * two-thousand-entry object literal makes every one of those edits touch the same hunk.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately *not* here
 *
 * `maps.title`, `markers.tooltip`, `controls.freeFlight.tooltip`, `blockTooltip.position`
 * and about seventy-five of their neighbours look exactly like keys this file should carry,
 * and carrying them would be a regression. They are upstream BlueMap's *viewer* keys, and
 * the thirty `public/lang/*.conf` files translate them properly into thirty languages.
 * `mergeVoiceInto` merges this catalogue on top of the loaded locale, so an entry here for
 * `maps.title` would replace the real German string with an English one for every German
 * reader. The rule is narrow and mechanical: if a key appears in `public/lang/en.conf`, it
 * belongs to upstream and never appears in this catalogue. `appCopy.test.ts` enforces it.
 *
 * `freeFlightControls.moveForward` and `zoomButtons.zoomIn` *are* ours despite the
 * neighbourhood: upstream's file carries `freeFlightControls.title`, `.invertMouseY` and
 * `.mouseSensitivity` and stops there, so the movement labels this app added are its own.
