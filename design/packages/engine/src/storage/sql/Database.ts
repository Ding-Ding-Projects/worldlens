 * upstream: storage/sql/Database.java
 *
 * Upstream wraps a JDBC {@code DataSource} — a commons-dbcp2 connection pool sitting on
 * top of whichever JDBC driver the dialect picked — and runs every action inside
 * {@code autoCommit=false}, committing on success and retrying once more (two attempts
 * total) when a {@code SQLRecoverableException} is thrown.
 *
 * There is no JDBC in JavaScript: MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite each need a completely
 * different client library with a completely different connection API, so this port
 * defines a small driver-agnostic connection contract ({@link SqlConnectionHandle}) that
 * each dialect's driver adapter (`drivers/*.ts`) implements against its own library, and
 * reproduces the same run/commit/retry shape on top of that contract instead of on top
 * of JDBC.
