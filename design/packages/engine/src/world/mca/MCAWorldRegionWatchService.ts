/**
 * Windows' `fs.watch` backend can assert when a chokidar directory watcher receives a
 * newly-created child event (`src\\win\\fs-event.c`, `_wcsnicmp(filename, dir, dirlen)`). This
 * is a process-level abort, not an ordinary watcher error: nothing catches it, the whole
 * process dies, and in the product that means the application disappears while a map is being
 * watched. So the affected runtime needs the safe polling backend. Keep the native watcher
 * everywhere else: polling is deliberately a compatibility fallback, not the default, because
 * this service may watch one folder per map.
 *
 * ## Why the bound moved from 26 to 24
 *
 * It was written as `major >= 26` when the abort was first seen on a Node 26 runtime. That was
 * the version somebody happened to be running, not the version the bug starts at, and the
 * difference stayed invisible because continuous integration pins Node 22 and runs no tests at
 * all, so nothing on a hosted runner has ever executed this path.
 *
 * Observed directly: Node **24.19.0** on win32 aborts with exactly that assertion, reproducibly,
 * from `MCAWorldRegionWatchService.test.ts`. It took down the whole `engine` and `server` test
 * runs, which read as two mysteriously empty suites rather than as a crash.
 *
 * The bound is therefore the lowest version observed to abort, not a guess at the true floor.
 * Node 22 and 23 are **not** verified here either way, and this comment says so rather than
 * implying they were cleared. If one of them is ever seen aborting, move the bound down again
 * and record the observation the same way; the cost of being wrong in that direction is a
 * process abort, while the cost of polling one folder too eagerly is a 100ms timer.

 * <ul>
 * <li>Like upstream ({@code ensureInitialization} / {@code FileHelper.awaitExistence}),
 * the directory-watch is only registered once the region-folder exists — until then its
 * existence is re-checked every second (upstream watches the parent-folder instead of
 * polling; chokidar's own handling of not-yet-existing paths is unreliable). Upstream
 * runs that check inside the blocking poll/take calls; the port re-checks on a timer so
 * the promise-based poll/take can resolve as soon as events arrive.</li>
 * <li>Upstream consumes events in batches per WatchKey, where repeated events on the
 * same file are coalesced (the event's count is incremented instead). The port queues
 * incoming events and coalesces repeats per region-position while they are pending; a
 * poll/take drains the whole queue as one batch.</li>
