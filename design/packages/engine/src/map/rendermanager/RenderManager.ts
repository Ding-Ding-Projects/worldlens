/**
 * upstream: `common/.../rendermanager/RenderManager.java`
 *
 * The worker pool that drives a whole map render: a queue of {@link RenderTask}s, a fixed
 * number of workers chewing on the head of that queue, a progress estimate, and the
 * start / stop / await controls around it. This is the piece that turns "render a tile"
 * into "render a map".
 *
 * ## The one structural fact that surprises everybody
 *
 * The pool is **not** N tasks running side by side. Every worker works on the *same*
 * task — the head of the queue — calling its `doWork()` over and over until it says it
 * has no more work; only then does the head retire and the next task begin. The queue is
 * strictly sequential and the parallelism lives *inside* a task. A port that gave each
 * worker its own task would look like the same pool, would be faster on a microbenchmark,
 * and would be wrong: `MapUpdateTask` and friends are written on the assumption that they
 * own the render state they touch for the duration of their turn at the head.
 *
 * ## Java's threading, and what each piece became here
 *
 * Upstream uses real threads, `synchronized`, `wait`/`notify` and `Thread.interrupt`.
 * None of those exist in JavaScript, so this ports the *behaviour*: a bounded number of
 * concurrent in-flight `doWork()` calls over the one event loop.
 *
 * | Java | here | why it is equivalent |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `WorkerThread extends Thread` | an `async` loop per worker | N loops each awaiting one `doWork()` at a time bounds in-flight work at N, which is the only thing the thread count ever bought |
 * | `synchronized (renderTasks)` | an unbroken **synchronous** region | see the note on {@link RenderManager.doWork} — the hazard here is an `await` mid-mutation, not preemption |
 * | `renderTasks.wait(ms)` | `#awaitSignal(#taskWaiters, ms)` | a timeout plus an explicit wake, which is what a timed `wait` is |
 * | `renderTasks.notifyAll()` | `#notify(#taskWaiters)` | resolving a promise queues a microtask, so the notifier keeps running to the end of its synchronous region exactly as a thread holding the monitor does |
 * | `worker.interrupt()` | `running = false` + a wake | cooperative: see the cancellation note below |
 * | `AtomicInteger busyCount` | a plain `number` | atomics exist to make read-modify-write indivisible; `this.#busyCount++` inside a synchronous region already is |
 *
 * **`worker_threads` was considered and rejected.** Nothing upstream's semantics need is
 * unavailable on one event loop: the pool never runs two tasks at once, never touches
 * shared mutable state from two places at the same instant (it holds a lock precisely so
 * it does not), and the work itself is storage IO, which Node already overlaps without
 * threads. What real threads would buy is CPU parallelism inside a single task's
 * `doWork()` — a genuine benefit, but a *performance* change that would force every
 * `RenderTask` to become serialisable across a worker boundary. That is a different port.
 *
 * ## Cancellation actually stops work
 *
 * `Thread.interrupt()` tears a thread out of a blocking call; there is no such thing here,
 * so cancellation is cooperative in two layers, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **Task level** — {@link RenderManager.removeRenderTask} and friends call
 *   `RenderTask.cancel()`, after which the task reports `hasMoreWork() === false` and the
 *   pool stops feeding it. This is upstream's own mechanism, unchanged: even in Java,
 *   removing the *running* task cancels rather than interrupts it.
 * - **Pool level** — {@link RenderManager.stop} clears `running` and wakes every waiting
 *   worker. A worker suspended in an idle wait resolves immediately and exits; a worker
 *   inside `task.doWork()` exits as soon as that call settles, because the loop condition
 *   is re-tested before another one is issued. What it does *not* do is abandon an
 *   in-flight `doWork()` mid-way — JavaScript cannot, and neither does upstream for work
 *   that is not sitting in an interruptible call.
 *
 * The failure this arrangement is written against is a pool that stops *reporting* work
 * while still doing it: had `stop()` only flipped a flag consulted by the progress
 * tracker, or had the worker loop re-checked `running` only after the queue drained, a
 * stopped manager would go on rendering tiles and writing render state with nobody
 * watching. The `running` test sits at the top of the loop and gates every single
 * `doWork()` call, so at most one call per worker outlives `stop()`.

     *
     * Java wraps everything from "read the head" to "increment busyCount" in
     * `synchronized (this.renderTasks)`, and the invariant it defends is the pairing of
     * **the head of the queue** with **`busyCount`**. Retiring a task is only safe when
     * `hasMoreWork()` is false *and* `busyCount` is zero at the same instant; if those two
     * facts are read at different moments, a worker can observe "no more work" from before
     * another worker incremented `busyCount`, retire a task that is still being worked on,
     * and then have that in-flight call decrement `busyCount` below zero — against the
     * *next* task, which then never retires at all, hanging the queue permanently.
     *
     * The equivalent hazard in a single-threaded runtime is not preemption, it is an
     * `await` between the read and the mutation, which lets another worker's continuation
     * run in the gap. So the port's guarantee is a syntactic one and can be checked by
     * reading it: **there is no `await` anywhere between the head read below and either the
     * `return` or the `busyCount` increment.** Every `await` in this method is either the
     * last statement on its path or the awaited work itself, by which point the pairing has
     * already been committed. The same argument covers the decrement in the `finally`,
     * which is likewise unbroken.
