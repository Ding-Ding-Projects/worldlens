# Intentional deviations from upstream

Per porting-conventions rule 5, this file records every place the TypeScript port
deliberately differs from upstream `vendor/BlueMap` (`e664c1a`) in behavior or API.
Bug-for-bug-preserved oddities are NOT listed here — only actual changes.

## Viewer package (`packages/viewer`)

### Mandated security deviations (porting-conventions rule 6)

- **Marker/popup HTML sanitization** — server-provided HTML is passed through
  `sanitizeHtml()` (DOMPurify, `src/util/sanitize.ts`) before `innerHTML` assignment:
    - `markers/HtmlMarker.ts` — `set html()` and `updateFromData()` (upstream
      `HtmlMarker.js:75,135`). Uses `markerData.html || ""` because DOMPurify throws on
      `undefined` where upstream would have rendered the literal string `"undefined"`.
    - `markers/PoiMarker.ts` — detail assignment into `labelElement.innerHTML`
      (upstream `PoiMarker.js:134`).
    - `markers/ObjectMarker.ts` — `LabelPopup` constructor sanitizes label/detail HTML
      (upstream `ObjectMarker.js:115`).
    - `markers/PlayerMarker.ts` — player-name `innerHTML` assignment (upstream
      `PlayerMarker.js:154`); not in the mandate's example list but covered by its
      "wherever server-provided HTML reaches innerHTML" clause.
- **`PopupMarker.ts`** — popup content is built as DOM elements with
  `addEventListener("click", ...)` calling `PopupMarker.copyToClipboard` directly instead
  of upstream's inline `onclick="BlueMap...."` attribute strings; no `window.BlueMap`
  global is required. Visible DOM structure and class names are unchanged.
- **`BlueMapApp.ts`** — upstream injects `settings.json` `scripts`/`styles` URLs into the
  document unconditionally (`BlueMapApp.js` `initGeneralEvents`/load path). The port keeps
  the mechanism but gates it behind the constructor option
  `{ allowRemoteInjection?: (kind: "script" | "style", url: string) => boolean }`
  (exported as `BlueMapAppOptions`), default `() => false`, logging a `console.warn` per
  blocked URL.

### Framework seams (no upstream equivalent)

- **Vue reactivity** — upstream wraps data objects with Vue's `reactive()` (9 call sites:
  `BlueMapApp`, `MapViewer`, `map/Map`, `controls/ControlsManager`,
  `controls/map/MapControls`, `controls/freeflight/FreeFlightControls`,
  `markers/Marker`, `markers/MarkerSet`, `util/CombinedCamera`). The port calls
  `makeReactive()` from `src/util/reactivity.ts`; the UI installs Vue's `reactive` via
  `setReactiveFactory()` at startup, default is identity. No `vue` imports remain.
- **i18n** — upstream `BlueMapApp.js`/`MainMenu.js`/`PopupMarker.js` import the vue-i18n
  global from `webapp/src/i18n.js` (out of scope for this package). Ported as an
  installable adapter seam `src/util/i18n.ts` (`i18n`, `setLanguage`, `setI18nAdapter`);
  the default adapter returns keys untranslated. The UI package must call
  `setI18nAdapter` at startup.

### Bug fixes / API-visible changes

- **`map/hires/PRBMLoader.ts`** — upstream `PRBMLoader.js:265` calls
  `new FileLoader(...)` without importing `FileLoader`, so upstream `load()` throws a
  `ReferenceError` at runtime (only `parse()` is ever used via `TileLoader`). TypeScript
  cannot compile an undeclared identifier, so the port imports `FileLoader` from
  `"three"`, making `load()` actually work. This is the only intentional runtime fix.
- **`BlueMap.ts` barrel** — TS-only type names collide across upstream's `export *`
  graph (`FollowingPlayerData` in map vs freeflight controls, `ColorLike` across marker
  modules). Resolved with explicit `export type` re-exports at the top of `BlueMap.ts`;
  these types do not exist upstream, so there is no JS-visible change.
- **`Utils.ts` (package root)** — `fetchHocon` no longer uses the `hocon-parser` package
  that upstream declares in the webapp `package.json`; it calls `parseHocon` from
  `@worldlens/shared` instead, because `hocon-parser` resolves substitutions with
  `eval` and the app's CSP forbids that. See "HOCON is parsed by a hand-written subset
  parser" under the shared package below.

### Lint-driven, behavior-identical mechanical changes

Applied across the package to satisfy the repo eslint config; none change runtime
behavior:

- never-reassigned `let`/`var` bindings converted to `const` (including splitting
  upstream multi-declarator statements in `PRBMLoader.ts`, `Stats.ts`, and converting the
  hoisted `var getDistanceToSquared` in `CSS2DRenderer.ts`, which is only called after
  the constructor has run);
- unused function parameters kept from upstream are `_`-prefixed (e.g. `update(_delta,
_map)` in controls, empty setter params in `CombinedCamera.ts`);
- unused `catch` bindings dropped (`catch (e)` → `catch`) in `BlueMapApp.ts`,
  `Utils.ts`, `map/Map.ts`;
- upstream-kept unused imports (`alert` in `MapViewer.ts`/`map/TileManager.ts`,
  `Vector2` in `controls/map/MapHeightControls.ts`, `animate`/`EasingFunctions` in
  `controls/freeflight/FreeFlightControls.ts`) retained under targeted
  `eslint-disable-next-line` comments;
- faithful `const self = this` / `const _this = this` aliases in `PRBMLoader.ts` and
  `CSS2DRenderer.ts` retained under targeted `eslint-disable-next-line` comments.

### Material Design 3 marker surfaces

The chrome around the map was ported to Material Design; the DOM the viewer paints *into*
the map was not, so POI labels, marker popups, player name tags and the block-info popup
were still upstream's design sitting inside a Material application. These deviations rebuild
them. Everything here is presentation and accessibility; no marker data, geometry or
anchoring semantics changes, and **every class name upstream emits is preserved** because
the viewer's TypeScript builds and queries this DOM by class.

- **`packages/ui/src/styles/markers.scss` is rewritten against `--md-sys-color-*`.** Upstream's
  `--theme-*` bridge in `global.scss` stays for author-supplied marker HTML, but the marker
  surfaces themselves now consume M3 roles declared at the top of `markers.scss` and derived
  from Vuetify's `--v-theme-*`. Vuetify publishes a single `surface` role, so the container
  tones, `outline`, `on-surface-variant` and `inverse-surface` are derived with `color-mix()`
  (a neutral tonal step toward `on-surface` plus the M3 surface tint). `--md-sys-color-shadow`
  is the one literal in the file, because M3 defines that role as neutral-0 in every scheme.
- **`--md-sys-color-outline` is 60%, not M3's mid-tone N-V50.** This hairline is the edge of a
  card drawn on terrain, and a mid grey is what grass and water already are. Leaning it away
  from the scheme's own surface is what keeps a dark popup readable over dark water.
- **Elevation is `filter: drop-shadow()`, not `box-shadow`.** The popups carry a CSS triangle
  in `::after`; drop-shadow follows the composite alpha silhouette so card and pointer cast
  one shadow. Upstream used the same mechanism for the same reason, with one flat shadow.
- **Popups and player name tags are sized `width: max-content` with a `max-width` cap.** This
  is a bug fix, not a style: a POI label is absolutely positioned inside `.bm-marker-html`,
  whose width is its 32px icon, so shrink-to-fit sized the label against 32px. Upstream wrapped
  it to its longest word; the added `overflow-wrap: anywhere` would have wrapped it to one
  character per line. The cap keeps upstream's 15em reach and adds a `60vw` bound.
- **Motion is opt-in under `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`,** so a reduced-motion
  preference needs no `!important` to undo it. The popup fades that upstream runs from
  javascript (`PopupMarker.open`/`close`, `ObjectMarker.LabelPopup.open`/`close`) read the same
  preference through the new `Marker.prefersReducedMotion()` and collapse to a zero-duration
  animation, which `animate` already runs as one synchronous frame at full progress.
- **`PopupMarker`'s copy-to-clipboard groups are `<button type="button" class="group">`,** not
  upstream's click-handled `<div>`. That is what makes them focusable, Enter/Space-operable and
  announced as buttons. Each carries a visually hidden `<span class="bm-sr-only">` repeating the
  `data-tooltip` text, because the visible hint is CSS generated content and `attr()` content is
  not exposed to assistive technology. The class name, the attribute and the children are
  unchanged, and `createGroup` still returns a plain `<div class="group">` for a null clipboard
  text.
- **Popups no longer dismiss on Tab.** `PopupMarker.removeHandler`, `LabelPopup`'s auto-close
  handler and `PoiMarker.onClick`'s handler all close on any interaction outside themselves,
  keydown included. Taken literally that made them unreachable by keyboard: Tab dismissed the
  popup before focus could land in it, so the copy controls were mouse-only. `Marker.isFocusNavigationEvent`
  exempts `keydown` of `Tab`/`Shift` only; every other key still dismisses, as upstream.
- **Accessible names on the two marker images.** `PoiMarker` sets the icon's `alt` from the
  marker's own label (upstream leaves the internal marker id there), taking the text of the
  sanitized label because labels are author HTML. `PlayerMarker`'s head image becomes `alt=""`:
  the player's name sits beside it as real text, so upstream's `alt="playerhead"` only made a
  screen reader announce a word per player that names nothing.
- **Not fixed, and deliberately so:** POI icons are still not individual tab stops. Making every
  marker in a scene focusable would put an unbounded tab sequence in front of the map canvas;
  the marker menu is the keyboard route to markers. A popup anchored near a viewport edge is
  still clipped by the CSS2D layer's `overflow: hidden`, exactly as upstream, because the
  surface is anchored to a point in the 3D scene and cannot be re-flowed away from it.

## NBT package (`packages/nbt`)

Ported from the BlueNBT library (as vendored by upstream) plus BlueMap's
`core/.../util/nbt` adapters. Runtime-model deviations forced by TypeScript's
erased types / missing reflection:

- **Buffer-based IO** — `NBTReader` reads from an in-memory `Uint8Array` instead of a
  streaming `InputStream` (chunk payloads are decompressed into memory anyway);
  `NBTReader.raw()` reconstructs the tag-id + name header instead of upstream's
  `DataLogInputStream` tap — byte-identical output. `NBTWriter` writes into a growable
  buffer exposed via `toUint8Array()` instead of an `OutputStream`.
- **Writer method names** — Java's overloaded `value(...)` becomes `valueByte`,
  `valueShort`, `valueInt`, `valueLong`, `valueFloat`, `valueDouble`, `valueString`,
  `valueByteArray`, `valueIntArray`, `valueLongArray` (JS cannot overload on numeric
  types). The `value(byte[], off, len)`-style partial-array overloads are not ported.
- **64-bit values** — LONG tags surface as `bigint`, LONG_ARRAY as `BigInt64Array`;
  `nextLongArrayAsBytes()` added for the packed-block-state hot path (zero-copy view,
  no per-element BigInt — see decisions D1); `LONG_AS_NUMBER` adapter added as a
  convenience for timestamp-like longs.
- **Schema model** — upstream's reflection-driven `DefaultDeserializerFactory` /
  `DefaultSerializerFactory` / `InstanceCreator` / `@NBTName` / `@NBTPostDeserialize`
  become explicit `ObjectSchema` objects (`create()` supplies the field-defaults,
  `FieldSpec.names` replaces `@NBTName`, `postDeserialize` replaces the annotation);
  `TypeToken` is an interned string-identified token instead of a captured
  `java.lang.reflect.Type`. Object-schema serialization writes fields in schema order
  (upstream: `HashMap` order — unspecified).
- **`nextArrayAs*Array`** — the generic `nextArray(Object|IntFunction)` reflection
  entry-points are not ported; the three `nextArrayAs*Array` conversions implement the
  same observable behavior (widening converts, narrowing throws an
  `IllegalArgumentException` like `java.lang.reflect.Array.setInt/setLong` would).
- **`RegistryAdapter`** — the package must stay dependency-free, so shared's
  `Key.parse` is injected as a `keyParser` constructor-argument and Key/Keyed/Registry
  are structural interfaces; `Logger.global.noFloodWarning` becomes an optional
  warning-callback (deduplicated per adapter instance, default `console.warn`).
- **`PalettedArrayAdapter.write`** — palette dedupe is keyed by SameValueZero equality
  (upstream: `equals`/`hashCode`); exact for strings/primitives, identity for objects.
- **Element-type resolution** — `CollectionAdapter`/`MapAdapter`/`LenientListAdapter`
  resolve their element-(de)serializer lazily per direction (upstream resolves both in
  the constructor), so deserialize-only registrations (e.g. `BlockStateDeserializer`)
  remain usable inside lists/maps.
- **`TypeResolver.onException`** — upstream's two default-method overloads are
  flattened into one optional method receiving `base?`; error classes
  (`IOException`, `EOFException`, `IllegalStateException`, ...) are ported so
  catch-semantics (e.g. `LenientListAdapter` only recovering from `IOException`s)
  stay intact.
- **`char` primitives** — `readChar`/char-adapters are not ported (unused by the
  engine schemas).

## Engine package (`packages/engine`)

### storage/compression

- **IO shape** — the `java.io` wrapper API (`OutputStream compress(OutputStream)`,
  `InputStream decompress(InputStream)`) is ported as overloads on the same method
  names: node-stream wrapping (`compress(Writable): Writable`,
  `decompress(Readable): Readable`) plus whole-buffer async
  (`compress(Uint8Array): Promise<Buffer>` etc.). The `Buffered(In|Out)putStream`
  wrappers are dropped — node streams buffer internally. `Compression`'s static
  interface fields become the merged `const Compression` object;
  `BufferedCompression` takes a `{stream, buffer}` pair where upstream takes a single
  `StreamTransformer` constructor-ref. `CompressedInputStream` is a
  (Buffer, Compression) pair (`getBuffer()` replaces reading the delegate stream);
  errors are `IOException`/`EOFException` from `@worldlens/nbt`.
- **ZSTD** — upstream's `io.airlift` `ZstdOutputStream`/`ZstdInputStream` stream
  incrementally; the port uses `@bokuweb/zstd-wasm`'s one-shot codecs (compression
  level 3 = airlift's/zstd's default), so the zstd node-stream API collects the whole
  payload in memory before coding. Frames are standard zstd (interop verified against
  node's native zstd codec in tests); one-shot compression additionally records the
  content size in the frame header, which airlift's streaming writer omits —
  decompression is unaffected.
- **LZ4** — `net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4BlockOutputStream`/`LZ4BlockInputStream` (lz4-java's
  own container, also used by MC 1.20.5+ region chunks) are reimplemented in
  `Lz4Block.ts` on lz4js' raw-block codec + xxhash-wasm; framing is byte-compatible,
  with every constant verified against lz4-java master sources — including the
  checksum being `xxhash32(decompressedBytes, seed 0x9747b28c) & 0x0FFFFFFF`
  (`StreamingXXHash32#asChecksum()`'s 28-bit `0xFFFFFFFL` mask,
  `StreamingXXHash32.java:106`). Decoder matches the default reader
  (`stopOnEmptyBlock = true`): stops at the terminating empty block, ignores trailing
  bytes, and rejects streams that end without it. One internal check differs:
  lz4-java verifies "compressed bytes consumed == compressedLength" while lz4js'
  block decoder consumes exactly compressedLength and reports the produced size, so
  the port verifies "produced == originalLength" (plus the checksum) — same
  corruption-rejection outcomes. Compressed block _content_ may differ from
  lz4-java's output for compressible data (different match search), which is fine —
  any spec-legal LZ4 block round-trips; RAW blocks and all framing are byte-identical.

### world/mca (MCAWorld / ChunkGrid / MCAWorldRegionWatchService)

- **Chunk-io is async** — upstream's caffeine `LoadingCache`s load synchronously on a
  cache-miss (blocking the render-thread); js cannot block, so `ChunkGrid.getChunk`
  returns a `Promise` (with explicit in-flight dedup so concurrent gets share one load,
  like caffeine's per-key computation; invalidation drops in-flight loads, so their
  results are not published — like caffeine discarding in-flight computations). The
  synchronous `World` interface (`MCAWorld.getChunk`, cursor-based block access) is
  served by `ChunkGrid.getCachedChunk`, which returns the cached chunk or — on a miss —
  schedules the async load and returns the loader's *empty* chunk for now. Renderers
  must therefore preload (`preloadRegionChunks`) the chunks they read; a miss shows up
  as an empty chunk instead of upstream's on-demand load.
- **Cache semantics approximated** — upstream: caffeine with `softValues` +
  `maximumSize(32 regions / 10240 chunks)` + `expireAfterWrite(10min)` +
  `expireAfterAccess(1min)`. Port: `lru-cache` with the same maximum sizes and
  `ttl = 10min` (write-anchored, lazily evicted on access). The additional 1-minute
  access-expiry is dropped (lru-cache has one ttl clock), and soft-references have no
  js equivalent — the size-bound alone limits memory.
- **Cache keys** — upstream interns `Vector2i` instances (`Vector2iCache`) to key the
  caches by `equals`/`hashCode`; js maps key by SameValueZero, so packed `"x,z"`
  strings replace the interned vectors.
- **Region watch-service on chokidar** (upstream: `java.nio.file.WatchService`) —
  (1) upstream's deferred registration (`ensureInitialization` +
  `FileHelper.awaitExistence` watching the parent-folder) becomes a 1s existence-poll
  that starts the chokidar watch once the region-folder exists (chokidar's own
  not-yet-existing-path handling silently loses folders created during its initial
  scan); (2) the blocking `poll(timeout, TimeUnit)`/`take()` become promises, with the
  timeout in milliseconds; (3) java coalesces repeated watch-events per file into one
  keyed event with a count — the port coalesces pending events per region-position and
  drains all pending positions as one batch per poll/take; (4) watcher failures are
  logged (debug) instead of surfacing as `IOException`s from poll/take.
- **`Logger.global`** — the logger-package is not ported (yet); `logError`/`logDebug`/
  `logWarning` calls in the mca-orchestration go to the console (see MCAUtil.ts).
- **Errors** — `ChunkGrid.loadChunk`'s retry-loop cannot chain earlier attempts via
  `addSuppressed` (js errors have no suppressed-list); only the last failure is logged.
  The loop retries *all* thrown errors where upstream retries
  `IOException | RuntimeException` (js cannot distinguish `Error` subtypes it doesn't
  own).
- **Legacy 1.12 extension-hook (not in upstream e664c1a)** — the modern upstream has no
  `getExtendedBlockState`; it is resurrected from legacy `v0.10.3-mc1.12` for the
  ported pre-1.13 chunk-format: `MCAWorld.getChunk` wraps `Chunk_1_12` instances in a
  cached view that applies `applyLegacyExtensions` on `getBlockState`, with a
  neighbor-callback resolving *raw* (unextended) block-states through the chunk-grid —
  matching the legacy call-graph where extensions read neighbors via the legacy
  `World#getBlockState` (which did not extend).

## Phase B consolidation (world model + MCA decoder integration)

Deviations the Phase B waves left as in-code notes, consolidated (the compression,
NBT-model and mca-orchestration deviations above are Phase B work too and are not
repeated here):

### world model (`packages/engine/src/world`)

- **Interface-defaults → abstract classes / helpers** — `Chunk` and `Region` (upstream:
  interfaces where every method has a default) are abstract classes so implementations
  inherit the defaults; `WorldLoader`'s `worldDataPacks` interface-default is the
  exported `worldDataPacks(loader, path, dimension)` helper (js interfaces cannot carry
  implementations).
- **Field/method name collisions** — Java allows a field and a method of the same name
  on one class, js does not; upstream fields are renamed where they collide with their
  accessor: `BlockState` `isAir/isWater/isWaterlogged` → `air/water/waterlogged`,
  `Chunk_1_13/1_16/1_18` `hasWorldSurfaceHeights/hasOceanFloorHeights` →
  `…HeightsPresent` (Chunk_1_12: `hasWorldSurface`), `BlockNeighborhood.thisIndex`
  (field) → `thisIndexCache`. Method APIs are unchanged.
- **`BlockProperties.Builder`** — a Java inner class mutating its outer instance;
  ported as the separate `BlockPropertiesBuilder` class holding that instance and
  reaching its private fields via element access.
- **Anvil loader-registration site** — upstream defines
  `WorldLoaderType.ANVIL = new Impl(Key.bluemap("anvil"), MCAWorld::load)` as a static
  on the interface; the port defines `ANVIL` in `world/mca/MCAWorld.ts` and
  self-registers it into `WorldLoaderType.REGISTRY` on module-load, so the
  world-package carries no runtime-dependency on the mca-package. Key, lookup and
  loader behavior are identical.

### world/mca decoders

- **Chunk_1_12 (not in upstream e664c1a)** — the pre-flattening chunk-format is
  combined back from the legacy `ChunkAnvil112` (`v0.10.3-mc1.12`) into the modern
  chunk-architecture (Chunk_1_13-style section array instead of the legacy fixed
  `Section[32]`); legacy semantics kept (`LightPopulated`/`TerrainPopulated`,
  `Level.HeightMap` as world-surface, no ocean-floor heights). In
  `MCAChunkLoader`'s sorted loader-list the Chunk_1_13 floor is raised from upstream's
  0 to 1344 and a Chunk_1_12 entry with floor 0 is appended, so DataVersions <= 1343
  (or absent) dispatch to the legacy decoder instead of upstream's (1.13-assuming)
  Chunk_1_13.
- **Legacy mappings from bundled assets** — the legacy `BlockIdConfig`,
  `BlockPropertiesConfig` and biome-table (upstream v0.10.3: user-editable configurate
  nodes with optional "autopopulation" writing resolved fallbacks back to disk) are
  backed by the bundled `assets/legacy/*.json` (extracted from the v0.10.3 default
  configs); autopopulation is not ported, the in-memory fallback-caching is kept.
- **Forge id-mappings are duck-typed** — the legacy `MCAWorld#getForgeBlockIdMapping`
  (read from level.dat `FML/Registries`) does not exist on the modern `MCAWorld`;
  `Chunk_1_12` consults it only if the world instance offers the method
  (`ForgeBlockIdMappings` duck-type), otherwise numeral-id mapping alone is used.
- **Explicit nbt-schemas** — upstream lets BlueNBT reflection derive the chunk/level
  Data classes from `@NBTName` annotations; the port registers explicit `ObjectSchema`s
  for every nbt-mapped mca-type in `MCAUtil.addCommonNbtSettings` (see the NBT-package
  schema-model deviation above). `MCAUtil.BLUENBT` is initialized lazily to keep the
  module-graph cycle (chunk-schemas register from `MCAUtil` while chunk-modules import
  its helpers) initialization-order safe.
- **`getValueFromLongStream` returns an int** — upstream returns a `long` that every
  call-site `(int)`-casts; the port returns the value's low 32 bits directly, extracted
  via an `Int32Array` view over the long-array's 32-bit halves (no per-element BigInt —
  decisions D1). Same applies to `PackedIntArrayAccess.get`.

### Phase C/D contract placeholders (replaced by the full ports)

- `resources/pack/datapack/DataPack.ts`, `resources/pack/resourcepack/ResourcePack.ts`,
  `map/hires/RenderSettings.ts` and `map/mask/Mask.ts` are minimal typed placeholders
  declaring only the surface the world/mca layer consumes (dimension-type/biome
  lookups, `getBlockProperties`, the ExtendedBlock render-settings subset, mask
  `test`/`isEdge`/`submask` + `NONE`/`ALL`); the upstream key-constants on `DataPack`
  are real. `util/Tristate.ts` and `util/WatchService.ts` are full ports (WatchService
  with the promise-shape noted in its header: `poll(timeoutMs)`/`take()` return
  promises, timeout in milliseconds instead of a `(timeout, TimeUnit)` pair).
- `DimensionTypeData` lives in `world/mca/data/DimensionTypeDeserializer.ts` until the
  resources-pack port lands (upstream:
  `resources/pack/datapack/dimension/DimensionTypeData`); its schema-registration
  yields to an already-registered `"DimensionTypeData"` token so the resources port
  can take the token over.
- **`ResourcePack.getColormaps()`** — the Phase C placeholder interface grew the one
  member `BlockColorCalculatorFactory.colorMap()` needs, typed as the structural
  `{ get(key: Key): ColorMap | null }` instead of upstream's
  `ResourcePool<ColorMap>` (lombok `@Getter`). The `ResourcePool` port arrives with the
  full `ResourcePack` port. Nothing else on the placeholder was expanded.

### map/hires renderer-type layer without the mesher (Phase D boundary)

- **`BlockRendererType` / `EntityRendererType` factories throw when called.** Upstream
  wires the concrete mesher renderers into the type constants
  (`BlockRendererType.DEFAULT/LIQUID/MISSING` → `ResourceModelRenderer::new`,
  `LiquidModelRenderer::new`, `MissingModelRenderer::new`;
  `EntityRendererType.DEFAULT/MISSING` → `ResourceModelRenderer::new`,
  `MissingModelRenderer::new`). Those renderers depend on `TileModelView`,
  `ArrayTileModel`, the real `RenderSettings`, `Variant` and `Part`, none of which are
  ported yet, so each `Impl` is constructed with a factory whose `create(...)` throws
  `"<key> renderer is not ported yet (Phase D)"`. Key identity, the `isFallbackFor`
  interface-default (`false`) and `REGISTRY` lookup — everything the Phase C
  `ResourcesGson` registry-adapters consume — are fully ported and behave as upstream.
  The mesher wave replaces the throwing factories with the real constructors.
- **Phase D type placeholders introduced by that layer** — `map/hires/TileModelView.ts`
  and `map/TextureGallery.ts` are one-member placeholder interfaces at their upstream
  paths (rather than duplicated per-file declarations, since both renderer packages
  need them), and `Variant` / `Part` are one-member placeholder interfaces declared in
  the single file that mentions each (`map/hires/block/BlockRenderer.ts` and
  `map/hires/entity/EntityRenderer.ts`). Each carries a `Phase D placeholder` banner
  naming the upstream file that replaces it. The single member exists only so the
  placeholder is not a structurally-empty (any-accepting) type.
- **`BlockColorCalculatorFactory` interface-defaults** — upstream is a functional
  interface, so java hands every lambda-implementation the combinators
  (`withBiomeOverlay`, `withBiomeColorModifier`, `blended`, `blended(h, v)`, `with`)
  for free. The port declares them on the interface and implements them once in
  `Impl`; every factory this module produces (including the `fixed` / `biome` /
  `colorMap` statics and the added `of(create)` lambda-form) is an `Impl`, so the
  fluent chaining upstream relies on is preserved. `BlockColorCalculatorType.Impl`
  spells out the lombok `@Delegate` forwarding of all six members explicitly.
- **`BlockColorCalculator`'s 2-arg interface-default** — `getBlockColor(block, target)`
  is exposed as `BlockColorCalculator.getBlockColor(calculator, block, target)` on the
  module's const-object, since a TS interface carries no implementation.
- **`ColorMap`'s image constructor** — upstream `ColorMap(BufferedImage)` builds the
  `int[65536]` then calls `this(colorMap)` *after* statements, which is not legal java
  and does not compile as written; the port implements the semantics (row-major
  `getRGB(0, 0, 256, 256, …)` of the 256×256 map into a flat `Int32Array(65536)`) via a
  constructor overload, packing pngjs' straight-alpha RGBA bytes into ARGB ints.
  `GenericMath.clamp` is a local helper; the array is an `Int32Array` rather than
  `number[]`.

### resources/pack foundations (`Pack`, `PackMeta`, `PackExtension`, `ResourcePool`)

- **`Pack` browses the `vfs` instead of `java.nio`.** Upstream mounts a zip/jar with
  `FileSystems.newFileSystem(root, null)` and walks it as `Path`s; the port uses
  `resources/pack/vfs` (`PackPath` / `ZipFileSystem` / `DirFileSystem`, already recorded
  as a port-addition), so `loadResourcePath`, `loadResources`, `Pack.list` and
  `Pack.walk` are `async` and take/return `PackPath`. `Pack.list`/`Pack.walk` return
  arrays instead of a `Stream<Path>`; `Pack.walk` reproduces `FileHelper.walk`'s
  depth-first pre-order (start-path included, vanished entries ignored).
- **No `Thread.interrupted()` poll.** `loadResourcePath` opens upstream with
  `if (Thread.interrupted()) throw new InterruptedException();`. There is no thread to
  interrupt here, so the check is dropped (the call-site comment marks the spot) and
  `loadResources`/`loadResourcePath` declare no `InterruptedException` equivalent.
- **`Pack#enabledFeatures` containment is by `Key#getFormatted()`.** Upstream's
  `Set<Key>#containsAll` compares with `Key#equals`; a js `Set` compares by identity, so
  the constructor additionally keeps the formatted strings of the enabled features and
  the feature-gate tests against those. The `Set<Key>` itself is returned unchanged by
  `getEnabledFeatures()`.
- **`PackMeta.Pack` is named `PackMetaPack`.** Java nests it inside `PackMeta`, where it
  does not collide with the `Pack` base-class of the same package; TypeScript has no
  nested classes, so the class is declared top-level under a non-colliding name and
  re-exposed as `PackMeta.Pack` (as are `PackMeta.Overlay(s)`, `PackMeta.Features` and
  `PackMeta.VersionRange`), matching the `BlockRendererType.Impl` precedent.
- **`PackMeta` deserialization is explicit, and an explicit `null` member keeps the
  default.** Upstream is a reflective-gson POJO
  (`FieldNamingPolicy.LOWER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`); each ported class carries a
  `fromJson` reading the same member names. Gson's reflective adapter *assigns* `null`
  to a field whose json member is explicitly `null`; the port treats explicit `null`
  like an absent member and keeps the field-initializer default, so no `@Getter`-typed
  member can come back null where upstream's type says it cannot.
- **`ResourcePool` is a plain `Map`, like upstream's plain `HashMap`.** Upstream uses a
  non-concurrent `HashMap` even though `ResourcePack` loads its packs in parallel; that
  is a real (if benign in practice) race in Java, and it cannot occur here because
  javascript has no preemption — the map is only ever mutated between `await` points, so
  no synchronization is added. The map is keyed by `Key#getFormatted()` (the same
  value-equality trick `Registry` uses) with the `Key` kept alongside, and `values()`,
  `keySet()` and `entrySet()` return snapshot arrays rather than upstream's live views
  (`entrySet()` yields `[Key, T]` tuples). `ResourcePool.Loader#load` may return a
  promise, so both `load` overloads are `async`.
- **`PackExtension`'s two interface-defaults become optional members plus invoker
  statics.** Both upstream members are `default … {}`, so an implementation may override
  none, some or all of them. A TS interface carries no implementation, so
  `loadResources`/`bake` are declared optional and the no-op default is applied by
  `PackExtension.loadResources(extension, roots)` / `PackExtension.bake(extension)` —
  the same const-object-static shape used for `BlockColorCalculator`'s 2-arg
  interface-default. Call-sites go through the statics so the default always applies.

### resources: minecraft-version acquisition and the datapack (`MinecraftVersion`, `util/FileHelper`, `DataPack`, `DatapackBiome`, `DimensionTypeData`)

- **`MinecraftVersion.load`'s download-consent flag is a required parameter with no
  default, anywhere.** Upstream's `allowDownload` comes from the `accept-download`
  core-config option (default `false`), whose configuration comment states that setting
  it true indicates acceptance of Mojang's EULA and of downloading a Minecraft client
  file. The port therefore refuses to give it a default value — including in tests,
  which pass it explicitly and stub the network. Only the jar download is gated;
  fetching the public version-manifest is not gated upstream and is not gated here.
- **The network is the injectable `FetchFunction` `VersionManifest` already defines.**
  `MinecraftVersion.load(id, dataRoot, allowDownload, fetchFunction?)` gains a fourth
  parameter that defaults to the global `fetch` and is threaded into
  `VersionManifest.getOrFetch`, `Version#fetchDetail` and `Download#createInputStream`,
  so no test ever touches the real Mojang servers.
- **`java.nio.Path` becomes an OS path-string** for `dataRoot`, `resourcePack` and
  `dataPack`, and the client-jar is mounted through the pack-vfs `ZipFileSystem`
  (`openFile` + `getRootDirectories`) instead of `FileSystems.newFileSystem`. Everything
  the jar-reading path does is consequently `async`.
- **`download()` streams through node's `crypto` SHA-1 instead of a
  `DigestInputStream`.** The body is read chunk-by-chunk from the fetch-response,
  each chunk updating the digest and being written to `<file>.unverified` through a
  `FileHandle`, so memory stays bounded. The upstream control flow is kept exactly: a
  failed or mismatching download is only *logged* (the `catch` returns rather than
  rethrowing), the `finally` deletes the unverified file, and it is the later
  `"Resource-File missing"` check that actually fails the call.
- **`FileHelper` ports only `walk`, `createDirectories` and `atomicMove`** — the members
  the resources layer needs. `createFilepartOutputStream`, `extractZipFile`, `copy` and
  `awaitExistence` belong to the storage/webapp layers and arrive with them.
  `atomicMove` is a single `fs.rename` (node has no separate non-atomic `Files.move` to
  fall back to, and a copy+delete fallback would not be a move); a missing source is
  swallowed exactly as upstream swallows `NoSuchFileException`, but a cross-device
  rename now surfaces as an error instead of silently degrading to a copy.
  `FileHelper.walk` returns a `Promise<string[]>` rather than a lazy `Stream<Path>` —
  every upstream consumer drains the stream immediately — and keeps the
  ignore-vanished-entries behaviour.
- **`MinecraftVersion`'s nested `VersionInfo`/`PackVersions` read json explicitly.**
  Without gson's reflective adapter and `FieldNamingPolicy`, `PackVersions.Adapter.read`
  reads the `resource_major`/`resource_minor`/`data_major`/`data_minor` members, the
  legacy `resource`/`data` aliases (upstream `@SerializedName(alternate = …)`) and the
  bare-int form, and leaves everything absent at the `(4, 0)` field-initializer defaults
  a jar without a `version.json` also yields.
- **`DataPack` exports the lookup-surface as an `interface` plus the concrete
  `Pack`-subclass as the value of the same name.** Upstream `DataPack` is one class, but
  the `world/mca` layer (and its tests) was already written against the Phase C
  placeholder's *structural* `DataPack` type and passes object-literal stand-ins for it.
  Making the type nominal would break those call-sites, so the module keeps
  `export interface DataPack { getDimensionType, getBiome ×2 }` and exports the class
  `DataPackImpl` as `export const DataPack = DataPackImpl` — `new DataPack(version)`,
  `DataPack.DIMENSION_OVERWORLD` and `dataPack: DataPack` all keep meaning exactly what
  they meant, and everything upstream `DataPack` does is on the class. The private
  `loadResources(Path)` overload is named `loadResourcesFromRoot` because TS cannot
  overload a public and a private method under one name.
- **`DatapackBiome.Data` and `Effects` are top-level exported classes** (`Data`,
  `Effects`) rather than nested static ones, each with an explicit `fromJson` replacing
  gson's reflective adapter; `Effects.fromJson` applies the `@PostDeserialize` hook
  through the established `postDeserialize()` helper. The upstream aliasing is kept
  bug-for-bug: an `Effects` that declares no colors hands out the *same* mutable `Color`
  instances as `Biome.DEFAULT` (no copy), so the hook's `waterColor.a = 1` is a write to
  the shared default — a no-op there, because that color's alpha is already 1.
- **`DimensionTypeData` now exists at its upstream path, and temporarily twice.**
  `resources/pack/datapack/dimension/DimensionTypeData.ts` is the real port and carries
  the gson-side `fromJson` the datapack loader needs; the NBT-side copy and its
  `ObjectSchema` still live in `world/mca/data/DimensionTypeDeserializer.ts` (see the
  Phase C placeholder note above) until the wave that consolidates them lands. Both
  spell the `@Accessors(fluent = true)` fields `skylight`/`ceiling`, because a TS class
  cannot have a field and a method of the same name. Lombok `@Data`'s
  `equals`/`hashCode`/`toString` are not ported — nothing in the port compares or prints
  a `DimensionTypeData`.

### resources/pack/resourcepack/blockstate (`BlockState`, `Variants`, `VariantSet`, `Variant`, `Multipart`, `BlockStateCondition`)

- **`VariantSet.hashToFloat` is exported (upstream: `private static`)** so the port's test
  can pin its arithmetic directly against values produced by running the upstream method
  verbatim on a JDK. It is the position-based PRNG that decides which variant every block
  in the world renders, so a silent divergence would mis-pick variants everywhere with no
  visible failure. The implementation is a literal transcription of the java expression on
  `BigInt` with `BigInt.asIntN(64, …)` at each step java wraps: the `int` operands widen
  to `long` *before* the multiply, and `hash * (hash + 456149)` is a wrapping 64-bit
  multiply. A `number` implementation is wrong twice over (the products are already
  rounded doubles when `^` coerces them, and the square is far above 2^53). An
  all-`Math.imul` implementation would in fact be exact — only the low 24 bits survive and
  both operations are congruent mod 2^24 — but it stops looking like the java it ports;
  the equivalence is pinned by a test so a later performance pass can rely on it.
- **`VariantSet.totalWeight` is a plain left-to-right sum.** Upstream sums with
  `DoubleStream#sum()`, which uses Kahan compensated summation. The two agree exactly for
  the small integer weights resource packs actually use, and differ by at most an ulp
  otherwise.
- **`Variant.Adapter` and `blockstate/BlockState.Adapter` are port additions.** Neither
  upstream class carries a `@JsonAdapter`; both are read by gson's reflective adapter
  driven by `FieldNamingPolicy.LOWER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` plus the type-adapters on
  `ResourcesGson`. Each ported adapter reads the same member-names with the same per-type
  adapters (`ResourcesGson.blockRendererType`, `ResourcePath.Adapter`, `Variants.Adapter`,
  `Multipart.Adapter`), keeps the field-defaults for absent members and ignores unknown
  ones — including `__comment`, which the reflective adapter also just skips.
  `Variant.Adapter` applies the `@PostDeserialize` hook through the established
  `postDeserialize()` helper; because the ported constructor already runs `init()`, the
  hook recomputes an identical transform rather than being the first to compute it.
- **`MISSING_BLOCK_MODEL` is declared in `Variant.ts`** (upstream:
  `ResourcePack.MISSING_BLOCK_MODEL`, `new ResourcePath<>("bluemap", "block/missing")`),
  the same way `model/Face.ts` declares `MISSING_TEXTURE`, until the full `ResourcePack`
  port can carry the statics. It is a module-level singleton exactly like upstream's
  `static final`: `ResourcePath` caches its resolved resource on the instance, so every
  defaulted `Variant` has to share the one path-object.
- **Constructor overloads collapse into defaulted/discriminated signatures.** `Variant`'s
  three public constructors become one signature whose parameter-defaults *are* the
  upstream field-initializers (so `new Variant(model)` and `new Variant(model, x, y, z)`
  leave exactly the fields untouched they leave untouched upstream), plus a no-argument
  form standing in for the private `@NoArgsConstructor`. `VariantSet`'s
  `VariantSet(Variant...)` / `VariantSet(BlockStateCondition, Variant...)` pair becomes
  one signature discriminated by `instanceof Variant`. `blockstate/BlockState` keeps its
  `Variants`-or-`Multipart` forms and gains a documented two-argument form for the gson
  field-assignment path, since upstream's reflective adapter writes both private fields
  independently and a json carrying both members produces an object neither public
  constructor can build.
- **`BlockStateCondition` splits into an interface and a same-named const.** Upstream is a
  `@FunctionalInterface` holding its implementations as nested classes and its factories
  as interface-statics; TypeScript needs the type in the type-space and the classes and
  factories in the value-space. The nested classes' constructors are consequently public
  rather than private (the factories no longer live inside the class bodies), and the
  `and`/`or`/`property` varargs become rest parameters — `property(key, ...values)` covers
  both upstream `property` overloads, since java resolves a single string to the 2-arg
  form and the varargs form delegates to it for a 1-element array. `MATCH_ALL`/`MATCH_NONE`
  are module-level singletons so `Variants.Adapter`'s reference-identity comparisons
  (upstream `==`, here `===`) against `all()`/`none()` keep working.
- **`Preconditions.checkArgument` is a local helper** throwing a plain `Error` with the
  upstream message instead of `IllegalArgumentException`.
- **`Logger.global.logDebug`** for an unparseable variant-key uses the mca package's
  `logDebug` console helper, as the other ported resources modules do.
- **Rotation angles are read as doubles.** Upstream `Variant.x/y/z` are `float`; the port
  reads them with `nextDouble` and keeps them as `number`, consistent with the already-
  ported `MatrixM4f` (double throughout) and the `Vector*Adapter`s. Every rotation a
  resource pack actually stores is an exact small multiple of 22.5, so no narrowing step
  is observable.
- **Member order comes from `Object.entries`.** `Variants` picks the *first* matching
  condition and returns, so the order of the members in a blockstate-json is behaviour,
  not decoration. The ported adapters iterate the parsed object with `Object.entries`,
  which preserves insertion order for ordinary string keys but hoists integer-like keys
  (`"0"`, `"12"`) to the front, ahead of gson's strict document order. No variant-key can
  be integer-like — `Variants` keys either are empty/`default`/`normal` or contain an
  `=`, and multipart `when` keys are minecraft property names — so the two orders agree
  for every real resource pack.

### resources/pack/resourcepack model, texture and entitystate packages (Wave C2b-2)

- **Explicit `Adapter`s where upstream used gson's reflective adapter.** `Element`,
  `Face`, `Rotation`, `Model`, `Part`, `EntityState` and `Texture` carry no gson
  `@JsonAdapter` upstream — gson deserializes them reflectively. Without a reflective
  gson each ported class exposes a `static readonly Adapter: JsonAdapter<T>` that reads
  exactly the members gson's field-naming policy would map: the resource-pipeline types
  under `FieldNamingPolicy.LOWER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` (so `Element.lightEmission` reads
  `light_emission`), and `Texture` under `FieldNamingPolicy.IDENTITY`, which is what
  `map/TextureGallery`'s own gson instance uses (`key` still serializes as
  `resourcePath`, per its `@SerializedName`). A json `null` member keeps the field
  default, matching gson's reflective adapter for primitive fields. `TextureVariable`'s
  and `AnimationMeta`'s hand-written upstream adapters are ported as-is, including
  upstream's "Failed ot parse" message typo.
- **`ResourcePool<T>` is a one-member placeholder interface** declared in
  `model/Model.ts` (`get(key): T | null`), since `resources/pack/ResourcePool.java` is
  not ported yet and every consumer in this wave — `TextureVariable.optimize`,
  `Face.optimize`, `Element.optimize`, `Model.optimize/applyParent/calculateProperties` —
  only performs that lookup. The full pool arrives with the `ResourcePack` port.
- **`ResourcePack.MISSING_TEXTURE` and `MISSING_ENTITY_MODEL` are declared locally** in
  `model/Face.ts` and `entitystate/Part.ts` respectively (same values as upstream:
  `bluemap:block/missing` and `bluemap:entity/missing`), because the ported
  `ResourcePack` is still a Phase C placeholder interface without the key-constants.
- **`synchronized` is a no-op.** Every `synchronized` method/block of `Model`
  (`optimize`, `applyParent`, `applyTextureVariable`, `calculateProperties`) and every
  `synchronized (TextureVariable.class)` block (a *global* lock, shared by all
  TextureVariable instances) is single-threaded in TS and survives only as a comment.
- **`TextureVariable`'s `isReference`/`isResolving` fields are renamed** `reference` /
  `resolving`: upstream has both a field `isReference` and a method `isReference()`,
  which one TS class cannot carry (same situation as `Color.isPremultiplied`).
- **Private constructors become callable overloads.** Upstream's gson-only
  `@NoArgsConstructor(access = PRIVATE)` and the private copy-constructors of `Element`,
  `Face` and `TextureVariable` are not expressible as private TS constructor overloads;
  the no-args form is a public overload (the Adapters construct through it) and each
  `copy()` builds a fresh instance and copies the fields, which is what the upstream
  copy-constructor does. `Texture`'s three constructors stay `private` (its statics and
  its Adapter are inside the class body).
- **`Model`'s varargs constructors take an array.** `Model(Element @Nullable ...)` and
  `Model(Map, Element @Nullable ...)` become `(elements: (Element | null)[])` /
  `(textures, elements)`, because TS cannot overload a rest parameter against the
  fixed-arity `(textures, elements, ambientocclusion)` forms. Upstream's bug of never
  assigning the `ambientocclusion` constructor argument is kept bug-for-bug.
- **`AnimationMeta.FrameMeta` is a sibling class** of the same module rather than a
  static nested class, and gains a `setTime(int)` because upstream's adapter writes the
  package-private `time` field directly when back-filling the default frame-time. The
  `(int) in.nextDouble()` casts (`frametime` and a frame's `time`) go through a local
  `javaIntCast` reproducing java's saturating narrowing cast.
- **`Texture`'s decoded-image cache is a `WeakRef`**, standing in for upstream's
  `SoftReference<BufferedImage>`; JS has no soft reference. The base64 string is always
  retained, so a collected image is simply decoded again by the next `getTextureImage()`
  call — upstream's exact behaviour with a more eager collector. `BufferedImage` itself
  becomes pngjs' `PNG` (see `util/BufferedImageUtil`), so `getTextureImage()` and
  `Texture.from` are synchronous and throw plain `Error`s instead of `IOException`.
- **`Texture`'s animation does not survive a textures.json round-trip.** Upstream's
  `AnimationMeta.Adapter` writes through gson's delegate (the bare AnimationMeta fields)
  but reads the `<texture>.png.mcmeta` shape, which only looks at an `"animation"`
  member — so a written animation reads back as the AnimationMeta defaults. Kept
  bug-for-bug and covered by a test.
- **`Rotation.getMatrix()` and `Part.getTransformMatrix()` return `MatrixM4f | null`**,
  matching the upstream transient fields, which are null until `init()` runs. Every
  construction path in this port runs `init()` (public constructors call it directly,
  the Adapters apply the post-deserialize hook), so the null only appears for a bare
  no-args construction — exactly as upstream.
- **`Element`'s `EnumMap<Direction, Face>` is a plain Map filled in `Direction.values()`
  order**, so it iterates like the upstream EnumMap (see the
  `EnumMapInstanceCreator` note above). The package-private `Element.isFullCube()` and
  `Face.init(...)` become public, as TS has no package-private visibility.
- **`map/hires/entity/EntityRenderer.ts` still declares its own `Part` placeholder.**
  The real `entitystate/Part` now exists, but `EntityRenderer.ts` belongs to the Phase D
  renderer-type layer and is left untouched by this wave; the mesher wave replaces the
  placeholder with an import of the real Part.
- **`TextureGallery`'s textures-file I/O is string-based.** Upstream's
  `writeTexturesFile(OutputStream)` / `readTexturesFile(InputStream)` become a
  `writeTexturesFile(): string` and a `static readTexturesFile(json: string)`; the utf-8
  encoding and the gzip wrapping are the (not-yet-ported) map-storage layer's job, so the
  two names it stores under are exposed as `TextureGallery.TEXTURES_FILE_NAME`
  (`textures.json`) and `TextureGallery.TEXTURES_FILE_NAME_GZIP` (`textures.json.gz`),
  standing in for upstream's `"textures.json" + Compression#getFileSuffix()` in
  `storage/file/FileMapStorage`.
- **`TextureGallery`'s json is written by a gson-compatible writer — no longer a
  deviation.** This entry used to say the file was written by `JSON.stringify` and that
  only its *spelling* differed. That was true, and it stopped being acceptable the moment
  the Phase D gate began comparing this file byte for byte: a document that parses to the
  same value is still a failure there. `writeGsonDocument` in `map/TextureGallery.ts` now
  reproduces gson's `JsonWriter` on both counts.
  - **Numbers**, via `javaDoubleToString`: java writes a `double` as `1.0`/`0.0`, and
    switches to `4.985044943168759E-4` outside `10^-3 <= |d| < 10^7`, where javascript
    writes `1`/`0` and `0.0004985044943168759`. Measured over the reference document's
    8368 numeric tokens, 713 were spelled differently and **none** differed in the digits
    themselves, so the function borrows javascript's shortest-round-trip digits and
    rebuilds only java's shell around them.
  - **Strings**, via `writeGsonString`: gson's default `htmlSafe` escapes `<`, `>`, `&`,
    `=` and `'` as `\u00XX`, plus U+2028/U+2029. The `=` is the one that mattered here —
    every texture is a base64 data-url and base64 padding is `=`, which the reference
    document spells `\u003d` 2074 times.

  Reading still goes through the strict `JSON.parse` rather than `adapter/JsonMapper`'s
  lenient parser, because the gallery's gson instance is
  `ResourcesGson.addAdapter(new GsonBuilder())` *without* the `setLenient()` that
  `ResourcesGson.INSTANCE` adds.
- **The base64 png inside a texture is encoded by pngjs, not by `ImageIO`, and the two pick
  different png formats.** Upstream's `Texture.from` writes the image with
  `ImageIO.write(image, "png", os)` (`resourcepack/texture/Texture.java:151`); the port
  uses `PNG.sync.write(image)`. For the same 16x16 texture, `ImageIO` emits a **palette**
  png (`IHDR` bit-depth 4, colour-type 3) where pngjs emits **truecolour + alpha**
  (bit-depth 8, colour-type 6). Both decode to the same pixels and `getTextureImage()`
  reads either back correctly, so nothing in the renderer can tell them apart — but the
  encoded bytes differ, so `textures.json` differs, and the gate compares that file byte
  for byte. This is the divergence that remains in it now that the writer above is
  gson-exact: *pixel-identical, byte-different*. Closing it means reproducing `ImageIO`'s
  png encoder — its palette-vs-truecolour decision, its filter choice and its zlib
  settings — which is a much larger job than the writer was, and is tracked separately
  rather than smuggled in here.
- **`TextureGallery` declares `ResourcePack.MISSING_TEXTURE` locally**, the same way
  `model/Face.ts` and `entitystate/Part.ts` do, instead of importing it from
  `ResourcePack` — that import would pull the whole pack-loader into the gallery for one
  constant. Nothing upstream ever calls `setResource` on that path, so its
  `getResource()` is always null and a separate instance behaves identically: the gallery
  keys by `Key#getFormatted()`, which is value-equal across instances.
- **`TextureGallery`'s `Map<Key, TextureMapping>` is keyed by `Key#getFormatted()`** with
  the `Key` kept alongside the mapping (a js `Map` keys objects by identity), the same
  shape `resources/pack/ResourcePool` uses. `TextureMapping` is a module-local class
  rather than a package-private static nested one, and the `synchronized` on both `put`
  overloads survives only as a comment (js has no preemption).
- **The engine barrel aliases three Phase-C exports** whose plain names were already
  taken by earlier waves, since `index.ts` is one flat namespace where upstream has
  packages: `resources/BlockPropertiesConfig` is exported as
  `ResourcesBlockPropertiesConfig` (the legacy v0.10.3 config from
  `world/mca/legacy/BlockPropertiesMapper` keeps `BlockPropertiesConfig`),
  `resources/pack/datapack/dimension/DimensionTypeData` as `DatapackDimensionTypeData`
  (the NBT-side copy in `world/mca/data/DimensionTypeDeserializer` keeps
  `DimensionTypeData`), and `resources/pack/resourcepack/blockstate/BlockState` as
  `ResourcePackBlockState` (the in-world `world/BlockState` keeps `BlockState`).
  `Pack.Loader` and `ResourcePool.Loader` — nested interfaces upstream — become
  `PackLoader` and `ResourcePoolLoader`, and `DatapackBiome`'s nested `Data`/`Effects`
  become `DatapackBiomeData`/`DatapackBiomeEffects`.
- **`ResourcePack#loadResources` takes an optional `AbortSignal`.** Upstream polls
  `Thread.interrupted()` between every one of its five phases (and between the four steps
  of `bake`) and throws `InterruptedException`; javascript has no thread-interruption to
  poll, so the method accepts an `AbortSignal` and checks it at exactly those points,
  throwing the signal's reason (a `DOMException` named `AbortError` when the caller aborted
  without one). Passing no signal is the "never interrupted" case. The `synchronized` on
  the method is a no-op in single-threaded js and is kept only as a comment.
- **`ResourcePack`'s seven parallel loaders are `await Promise.all`.** Upstream fans
  atlases, blockstates, entitystates, models, colormaps, `blockColors.json` and
  `blockProperties.json` out as `CompletableFuture.runAsync(..., BlueMap.THREAD_POOL)` and
  `join()`s them; here they are seven async functions awaited together. No two of them
  write the same pool or config, and javascript has no preemption, so `ResourcePool`'s
  plain (non-concurrent) Map is exactly as safe here as upstream's `HashMap` is there —
  and the sequential loop inside each loader keeps the "don't load already present
  resources" first-wins ordering. Upstream's `catch (RuntimeException) -> IOException`
  rewrap around the `join()` has no analogue: the port has one exception type, and every
  throw inside the loaders is already caught by `ResourcePool#load` or by the config
  loaders' own try/catch.
- **`ResourcePack` reads `blockColors.json` / `blockProperties.json` through
  `loadFromString`.** Upstream passes the `Path` to `BlockColorsConfig#load(Path)` /
  `BlockPropertiesConfig#load(Path)`, which open it with `Files.newBufferedReader`; a
  `PackPath` may live inside a zip, so the pack-loader reads the text through the vfs and
  hands it to the `loadFromString` split-out those two configs already provide.
- **`ResourcePack`'s two caffeine `LoadingCache`s become `lru-cache` instances keyed by a
  canonical string.** Upstream keys `blockStateCache` / `blockPropertiesCache` on the world
  `BlockState` itself, which hashes and compares by its id plus its *sorted* property
  array; a js Map compares by identity, so the key is the equivalent
  `namespace:value[k=v,…]` serialization with the properties sorted. `maximumSize(10000)`
  becomes `max: 10000` and `expireAfterAccess(1, MINUTES)` becomes `ttl: 60_000` with
  `updateAgeOnGet`. Like caffeine, a null loader-result is returned but not recorded, so
  `getBlockState` keeps returning `null` for a blockstate the pack has no resources for.
- **`ResourcePack.MISSING_BLOCK_MODEL` is the object `blockstate/Variant` already holds;
  `MISSING_TEXTURE` and `MISSING_ENTITY_MODEL` are not.** A `ResourcePath` caches its
  resolved resource per instance, so upstream's `static final`s have to stay single
  objects. `Variant` exports its `MISSING_BLOCK_MODEL` and `ResourcePack` re-exposes that
  very instance. `model/Face` and `entitystate/Part`, however, hold their own module-level
  `MISSING_TEXTURE` / `MISSING_ENTITY_MODEL`: importing them from `ResourcePack` would
  close an import cycle (`ResourcePack` -> `Model` -> `Element` -> `Face`) whose top-level
  `const` initializers would hit the temporal dead zone. Both are only ever used as *keys*
  on those two paths, so the duplicated resource-cache is unobservable.
- **`ResourcePack.Extension` is a module-level interface plus a same-named const.** A TS
  interface cannot be nested in a class, so the upstream nested
  `Extension<T extends ResourcePackExtension>` is exported from the module and its
  `Registry<Extension<?>>` lives on the const; `ResourcePack.Extension` is a static alias
  of that const, so upstream's `ResourcePack.Extension.REGISTRY` call-sites keep their
  spelling. `getExtension` returns `T | null` (upstream's `Map#get` result).
- **`ResourcePackExtension`'s interface-defaults become optional members plus
  invoker-statics**, exactly like `PackExtension` above it: `collectUsedTextureKeys`,
  `getBlockStateKey` and `getBlockProperties` are optional on the interface and the
  `ResourcePackExtension` const-object applies upstream's defaults (`Set.of()`, the key
  unchanged, and a no-op) at the call-sites.
- **`ResourcePack#collectUsedTextureKeys` de-duplicates by `Key#getFormatted()`** — a java
  `HashSet<Key>` compares by `Key#equals`, a js Set by identity — and the texture-filter
  predicate handed to the atlas compares the same way. Upstream adds
  `textureVariable.getTexturePath()` to the set even when it is null (a resolved reference
  that found nothing); a null entry can never match a lookup, so it is skipped here
  instead of keyed.

### resources/pack/resourcepack/atlas (`Atlas`, `Source`, `SourceType`, `SingleSource`, `DirectorySource`, `UnstitchSource`, `PalettedPermutationsSource`) — Wave C3-2

- **The file-system separator dance is dropped.** `Source#getFile` replaces every `/` of a
  key's value with `root.getFileSystem().getSeparator()`, and `DirectorySource#load`
  translates its `source` into that separator and the walked relative path back out of it,
  because a java zip-filesystem separates with `/` while the OS one may separate with `\`.
  `PackPath` is posix-style everywhere, so all three replacements are no-ops and are simply
  not ported.
- **The polymorphic source-adapter lives in `SourceType.ts`, not in `Source.ts`.** Upstream
  annotates `Source` with `@JsonAdapter(Source.Adapter.class)`, and that adapter references
  `SourceType.REGISTRY`, which references the concrete subclasses, which extend `Source`.
  As ES modules that is a cycle `Source → SourceType → SingleSource → Source`, and whenever
  `Source.ts` is evaluated first the subclass module runs its `extends` clause while the
  base class is still in its temporal dead zone. The two-pass reader is therefore
  `SourceType.Adapter`; what stays on the base class is upstream's *delegate* adapter
  (gson's reflective adapter for `Source.class`, which reads nothing but `type`), named
  `Source.DelegateAdapter` so a subclass' own `Adapter` does not shadow it as an inherited
  static.
- **`SourceType.Impl` carries the concrete adapter instead of a `Class<? extends Source>`.**
  Upstream's class-literal exists only to be handed to
  `gson.getDelegateAdapter(TypeToken.get(type))`; without gson's reflective registry the
  registry-entry holds that adapter directly, and `getType()` becomes `getAdapter()`. The
  five registered keys are unchanged, `minecraft:filter` included — it maps onto the plain
  `Source`, i.e. onto a deliberate no-op, and re-parses the element with
  `Source.DelegateAdapter`.
- **A source without a `type` throws a `JsonParseError`.** Upstream reaches
  `SourceType.REGISTRY.get(null)`, which is a `ConcurrentHashMap#get(null)` and therefore a
  `NullPointerException` out of the parse; the port throws its own error in the same place
  rather than dereferencing null.
- **`Atlas`' `LinkedHashSet<Source>` becomes a `Map` keyed by `Source#equalityKey()`,** since
  a js Set de-duplicates by identity. The key reproduces what upstream's equality actually
  amounts to, which is *not* structural: `Source#equals` returns false as soon as
  `getClass() != Source.class`, and every subclass guards its own comparison with
  `if (!super.equals(object)) return false`. So only a bare `Source` (an unknown or
  `minecraft:filter` source) ever de-duplicates — by its type — while two structurally
  identical `SingleSource`s are kept apart. Each subclass therefore overrides
  `equalityKey()` with a per-instance identity, and a test pins both halves of that
  behaviour. `getSources()` returns a snapshot array where upstream returns the live set.
- **`UnstitchSource#regions`, `PalettedPermutationsSource#textures` and
  `PalettedPermutationsSource#permutations` become ordered arrays / a `Map`.** They are
  gson-materialised `LinkedHashSet`s and a `LinkedHashMap` upstream, so the adapters
  de-duplicate on the way in (structurally for `Region`, by formatted key for the texture
  list) and keep the insertion order. `Region` is a sibling class of the same module rather
  than a static nested class, and — unlike the sources — it really does compare
  structurally, so its `equalityKey()` is the real thing.
- **A json-`null` region element is dropped at parse-time.** Upstream keeps it as a null
  entry of the `LinkedHashSet` and skips it again with `if (region == null) continue` in
  `bake`; the port drops it in the adapter, which is the same observable behaviour without
  a nullable element type.
- **`getSubimage` copies, and the awt exceptions get stand-ins.**
  `BufferedImage#getSubimage` returns a *view* onto the parent raster; pngjs has no such
  thing, so each unstitched region is copied out pixel-for-pixel (upstream materialises the
  copy immediately afterwards anyway, when `Texture.from` writes the base64 png). Its
  bounds-checks are reproduced explicitly and throw a `RasterFormatError` standing in for
  `RasterFormatException`, which is what `UnstitchSource#bake` catches to log and skip an
  out-of-bounds region; any other error is re-thrown. Likewise `PalettedPermutationsSource`
  checks the palette coordinates itself and throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsError` where
  `BufferedImage#getRGB` would throw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, because pngjs would
  silently read `undefined` past the end of a too-small permutation palette instead of
  failing — that exception is precisely what upstream catches to log and skip the
  permutation.
- **`load` and `bake` are asynchronous** (upstream: `throws IOException`), because every
  `PackPath` operation is, and `Atlas#load`/`Atlas#bake` therefore await each source in
  turn. Upstream's `forEach` catches `IOException`; the port catches every error, since JS
  has no checked-exception distinction to make — the debug-log message is unchanged.
- **An undecodable image throws instead of reading as `null`.** `ImageIO.read` returns null
  when no reader recognises the bytes (and only throws for a corrupt but recognised image),
  so upstream skips such a file silently; pngjs' `PNG.sync.read` always throws. The texture
  is not loaded either way — the difference is one extra debug-log line, emitted by
  `ResourcePool#load` for a `DirectorySource` and by `Atlas#load` for a `SingleSource`.

## Shared package (`packages/shared`)

### HOCON is parsed by a hand-written subset parser, not a library

Upstream reads `.conf` files with a JVM HOCON library on the server side, and the upstream
webapp reads them in the browser with the `hocon-parser` npm package. The port replaces both
with `packages/shared/src/hocon.ts` (`parseHocon`), a dependency-free tokenizer plus
recursive-descent parser, and drops `hocon-parser` from `packages/ui` and `packages/viewer`.

**Why.** `hocon-parser` resolves `${...}` substitutions by calling `eval` (its
`index.js:311`). The Electron shell sets a deliberately strict Content Security Policy
(`script-src 'self'`, no `unsafe-eval`, itself a documented deviation from upstream in
`packages/app/src/main/index.ts`), so that call is refused at runtime with `EvalError`. The
locale load threw before any messages were registered and the entire UI rendered blank
(issue #16). Relaxing the CSP was rejected: the app loads content from remote BlueMap
servers, so `unsafe-eval` would trade a real security property for a dependency's
implementation detail. Precompiling the 30 bundled locales to JSON would not have been
enough either, because `viewer/src/Utils.ts#fetchHocon` parses `.conf` files served by a
*remote* server at runtime, where no build step can reach.

**Supported subset.** Objects, braced or as an unbraced document root; `key = value`,
`key : value`, and `key { ... }` with no separator; dotted-path keys expanding into nested
objects; duplicate keys resolving the HOCON way (later wins, two objects deep-merge);
quoted strings with the standard escapes plus `\uXXXX`; triple-quoted multi-line strings;
unquoted strings; numbers, `true`, `false`, `null`; arrays with comma or newline separated
elements; `#` and `//` comments; and concatenation of adjacent value parts on one line.

**Deliberately not supported, and rejected with a thrown `HoconParseError` rather than
guessed at:** `${...}` substitutions (the feature that needed `eval`), `include` directives,
and `+=`. The parser contains no `eval`, no `new Function`, no dynamic `import()` and no
other dynamic code path; a test asserts this against the source text. It is bounded against
a hostile `.conf` from a remote server: input length is capped (4 MiB by default), nesting
depth is capped (64 by default), every loop consumes at least one character before it can
iterate again, and no regular expression it uses can backtrack super-linearly. A `__proto__`
or `constructor` key is written with `Object.defineProperty` so a remote document cannot
reach `Object.prototype`.

**One deliberate behavioural difference from `hocon-parser`, in the port's favour.**
`packages/shared/src/hocon.test.ts` proves the new parser byte-for-byte identical to
`hocon-parser@1.0.1` on 28 of the 30 bundled locale files, against output captured from the
old package before it was removed (`packages/shared/test-fixtures/hocon-locale-baseline.json`).
The two exceptions are `id.conf` and `zh-CN.conf`, which indent with U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE.
`hocon-parser` did not treat U+00A0 as whitespace, so a no-break space between a block's last
value and its `}` started a new key, and its `}` branch returns that pending key *instead of
the object it just parsed*. Indonesian lost 24 of its 25 top-level entries and Simplified
Chinese lost `chunkBorders`; both rendered as raw message keys. The port treats U+00A0 as
whitespace and parses both files correctly, so fixing the CSP crash also fixes those two
locales. The divergence is asserted rather than tolerated: the test pins the exact set of
differing paths, requires the old value at each to have been a whitespace-only string, and
requires every other path in those two files to still match the baseline exactly.

## resources/pack/resourcepack/legacy (pre-flattening 1.12 compatibility)

Upstream shipped <= 1.12.2 support as an entire parallel branch (`v0.10.3-mc1.12`), with its
own `ResourcePack`, `BlockStateResource`, `BlockModelResource` and `TextureGallery`. This
port has one pipeline, so the era-differences are expressed as a `ResourcePackExtension`
instead of a second pipeline. Nothing in `ResourcePack`, `Pack` or the atlas-layer changes.

- **The era is detected from `pack.mcmeta`, which upstream never had to do.** The legacy
  jar was built for one era, so it simply assumed it; here `pack_format <= 3` (the last
  pre-flattening format) selects the compat behaviour per pack-root. The test is
  deliberately conservative — it takes the largest format the meta declares anywhere and
  treats an absent `pack_format` as modern, because `PackMeta`'s absent-member default is
  the *unbounded* range and would otherwise classify every meta-less pack as 1.12.
- **A synthetic `minecraft:blocks` atlas stands in for resolve-on-demand texture loading.**
  The 1.12 era has no atlas: `BlockModelResource.Builder#getTexture` turned a reference
  straight into `assets/<ns>/textures/<reference>.png` and handed it to
  `TextureGallery#loadTexture`, lazily, the first time a model named one. The modern
  pipeline instead *discovers* textures through the `minecraft:blocks` atlas and decodes
  the subset that survives the texture-key filter, so a pack with no `atlases/blocks.json`
  yields zero textures. The compat layer registers an atlas of `minecraft:directory`
  sources, which addresses exactly the same set of files; the key-filter then reduces it to
  the same subset upstream loaded lazily. Discovery-then-filter, rather than
  resolve-on-demand, reaching the same result.
- **The synthetic atlas maps the pre-flattening texture directories in both directions.**
  Each of `blocks`/`items` is crossed with its flattened name (`block`/`item`) in both
  roles — the directory scanned and the prefix the file is named with — giving eight
  sources. Upstream needed no such mapping because a legacy jar only ever met legacy
  packs; here a legacy pack can be stacked with modern ones, and BlueMap's own legacy
  `resourceExtensions` already mix the eras (`assets/bluemap/textures/blocks/missing.png`
  against this port's `bluemap:block/missing`). The extra sources are close to free: a
  missing directory walks nothing, and an unreferenced name never passes the key-filter.
- **A bare 1.12 model reference is repaired by caching the resource onto its
  `ResourcePath`, not by rewriting the reference.** Legacy
  `BlockStateResource.Builder#loadModel` resolved a blockstate's model against
  `models/block`, so a 1.12 blockstate names it bare (`"stone"`); the modern loader
  resolves against `models/` and registers the same file as `minecraft:block/stone`.
  `ResourcePath` is a `Key` and immutable, and `Variant#model` is private, so the compat
  layer instead fills the path's resource-slot with `setResource` — the same slot
  `getResource(supplier)` would have filled, and the one every consumer of a variant's
  model goes through upstream and here. The reference still *reads* as `minecraft:stone`;
  it simply resolves. The shared `MISSING_BLOCK_MODEL` singleton is explicitly excluded,
  since caching onto it would give every model-less variant in the process the same wrong
  model.
- **The extension registers itself on import.** Upstream's core ships no extensions (its
  platform-modules register theirs), so there is no composition-root here to do it. The
  module calls `registerLegacyResourcePackExtension()` at import — idempotent, since
  `Registry#register` is putIfAbsent — and exports it so a composition-root can do it
  explicitly instead.
- **The `"normal"` variant-key needed no compat code.** Legacy
  `BlockStateResource.Builder#parseConditionString` mapped `""`, `"default"` and
  `"normal"` onto the `all()` condition; `Variants.Adapter#parseConditionString` already
  does the same, so a 1.12 blockstate's `"normal"` becomes the default variant unchanged.
  The 1.12-only `"all"` and `"map"` keys that legacy skipped explicitly ("some exceptions
  in 1.12 resource packs that we ignore") reach the same fate by a different route: neither
  parses as a property, so both become the `none()` condition and are dropped. Both are
  pinned by test rather than assumed.

## Storage layer and map assembler (`packages/engine/src/storage`, `.../map`)

- **The storage layer is buffer-oriented, not stream-oriented.** Upstream's `ItemStorage`
  and `GridStorage` hand out an `OutputStream` to write into and a `CompressedInputStream`
  to read from, both closed by the caller. This port's `CompressedInputStream` was already
  a `(Buffer, Compression)` pair when it landed in Phase B, and every upstream caller of
  `write()` writes one complete document in one go, so the ported signatures are
  `write(data: Uint8Array): Promise<void>` and `read(): Promise<CompressedInputStream | null>`.
  The bytes on disk are the same either way; what is lost is upstream's ability to stream a
  tile larger than memory, which no caller does. Every method is `async` for the same
  reason the compression layer is.
- **`Stream<T>` returns become arrays.** `Storage#mapIds` and `GridStorage#stream` return
  `Promise<string[]>` / `Promise<Cell[]>`; every upstream consumer drains the stream
  immediately, and `util/FileHelper#walk` already made the same choice.
- **Caffeine `LoadingCache` becomes a plain `Map`.** `FileStorage#map` and
  `FileMapStorage#lowresTiles` cache their sub-storages in a `Map` rather than a
  size-bounded cache. Both caches are keyed by map-id and by lod, so they are bounded by
  the configuration rather than by traffic — there is nothing for an eviction policy to do
  (decision D6 covers the caches that genuinely need byte budgets).
- **`FileGridStorage`'s item-path codec is imported, not re-ported.** `getItemPath` and the
  `ITEM_PATH_PATTERN` parsing inside `stream()` live in `shared/TilePathCodec`, which the
  webapp shares — it is the same codec, and it was ported once.
- **`GridStorage.Cell` is exported from the engine barrel as `GridCell`.** It is a nested
  interface upstream; a barrel cannot carry a name that generic. The class
  `GridStorageCell` keeps its own name.
- **`BmMap`'s constructor becomes the static async `BmMap.create`.** Upstream's constructor
  loads the render-state and the texture gallery from storage and writes `settings.json`,
  which a javascript constructor cannot do. `renderTile`, `unrenderTile` and every `save`
  are `async` for the same reason.
- **`synchronized void save()` becomes a promise chain.** Javascript has no preemption, so
  most of upstream's `synchronized` needs no counterpart — but `save()` now awaits, and two
  overlapping calls would interleave at those awaits. `BmMap#save` therefore queues itself
  on a `saveChain` promise, which is the guarantee `synchronized` was giving.
- **`BmMap#save(long minTimeSinceLastSave)` is named `saveIfDue`.** TypeScript cannot
  overload one name across two different return types (`Promise<boolean>` and
  `Promise<void>`) without a signature that lies about one of them.
- **`BmMap#markerSets` cannot be serialized faithfully yet.** Upstream writes it with
  `MarkerGson`, whose adapters are part of the markers API (Phase H). Until that lands
  nothing can put a `MarkerSet` into the map — the element type is `never` — so the only
  document `saveMarkerState` can produce is the `{}` that upstream also writes for a render
  with no configured marker-sets.
- **`BmMap` names `LowresTileManager` structurally while it is being written.** The two
  files land in the same wave, so `BmMap.ts` declares `LowresTileManagerLike` with
  upstream's members and upstream's signatures and takes the manager from a factory
  parameter. The concrete class satisfies it without naming it; the interface and the
  factory parameter are replaced by a plain `import type` and a direct `new` once
  `map/lowres/LowresTileManager.ts` exists.
- **`MapSettingsSerializer` builds the json object directly.** Upstream registers it as a
  gson `JsonSerializer<BmMap>` on `BmMap.GSON`; this port calls it and hands the result to
  `JSON.stringify`. The two nested values gson would delegate to a registered adapter
  (`Vector2i`, `Color`) go through this port's `Vector2iAdapter` and `ColorAdapter`, so
  they cannot drift from the rest of the resources layer.
- **`settings.json` is compared by value, not byte for byte** (`tools/oracle`). Gson prints
  a java `float` as `0.0` where `JSON.stringify` prints `0`, and gson html-escapes `=`,
  `<`, `>`, `&` and `'` inside strings. Same document, different bytes. The same applies to
  `live/markers.json` and `live/players.json`. The hires tiles — the actual mesh — are
  compared byte for byte after decompression, and lowres PNGs pixel for pixel (decision
  D3), which is the Phase D gate.

### storage/sql (issue #32)

- **JDBC becomes a small driver-agnostic connection contract, not one shared client.**
  Upstream's `Database` wraps one JDBC `DataSource`; any dialect works because the JDBC
  driver hides the wire protocol. There is no javascript equivalent — MySQL, PostgreSQL
  and SQLite each need a completely different client library — so `SqlConnectionHandle`/
  `SqlDriverAdapter` (`Database.ts`) is this port's substitute, and each dialect's driver
  module (`drivers/*.ts`) implements it against its own library.
- **The four-dialect `Impl` class in upstream's `Dialect.java` splits into a
  `createCommandSet` and a `createDriverAdapter` per dialect** (`Dialect.ts`). Upstream's
  version only needs the former, because a JDBC `Driver` is already interchangeable.
- **A driver package is optional and loaded through a non-literal dynamic `import()`**
  (`drivers/loadOptionalModule.ts`), so esbuild cannot inline `mysql2`/`pg`/`sql.js` into
  the app bundle, and a missing one raises `MissingSqlDriverError` naming the package
  rather than a raw module-resolution stack trace — no upstream equivalent; JDBC has no
  concept of an optional npm dependency.
- **Generated-key retrieval re-runs the `SELECT` instead of reading back a
  driver-generated id.** Upstream's `findOrCreate*Key` methods use JDBC's
  `Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS`; node-postgres has no equivalent short of an
  `INSERT ... RETURNING` clause, which would change the literal statement text this port
  keeps byte-for-byte identical to upstream's. The four `create*KeyStatement()` texts are
  therefore unchanged, and `AbstractCommandSet.findOrCreateKey` just re-selects after a
  successful insert — one extra round trip on the very first write of a brand-new key,
  paid once per key per process since every result is cached.
- **No recovery for the SELECT-then-INSERT race upstream also does not guard against.**
  Two processes creating the same brand-new map/compression/storage key at the same
  moment can both see an empty `SELECT` and both attempt the `INSERT`; upstream has no
  handling for this either (its per-cache `synchronized` block only serializes callers
  within one JVM process), so this port matches that rather than inventing a recovery
  path — one that would have to special-case PostgreSQL anyway, since a constraint
  violation there aborts the whole surrounding transaction in a way SQLite and MySQL do
  not.
- **`PageSpliterator` becomes `collectPages`, an eager async loop** (`PageSpliterator.ts`),
  consistent with every other lazy `Stream` in this port's storage layer already being
  collected (see the buffer-oriented/array-returning notes above). It stops one round
  trip earlier than upstream's `refill()` when a page comes back short: since every page
  here reports its true length, a short page unambiguously is the last one.
- **`mapKey`'s find-or-create semantics recreate a deleted map's row on the very next
  grid/item access.** Checked directly against `AbstractCommandSet.java` before writing
  `SqlStorage.sqlite.test.ts`'s test for it — this is upstream's actual behavior (`mapKey`
  has no notion of "this map existed and was deleted"), not a port-introduced bug.
- **`driver-jar`/`driver-class` are refused, not silently ignored.** `StorageFactory.ts`
  throws a named `InvalidStorageConfigError` for a config that sets either — there is no
  way to load an arbitrary JDBC jar from a classpath at runtime in javascript, and this
  port always uses its own built-in driver for the resolved dialect regardless, so
  letting the setting through unused would be a silent lie about what it does.
- **MySQL 8.4.6, over a real server, rejects a bound `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` `?` parameter on
  mysql2's server-side prepared-statement path — MariaDB 11.4.7 does not.** Found running
  `SqlStorage.realServer.test.ts` (issue #32) against three throwaway Docker containers,
  not assumed: every paginated statement (`listMapGrids`, `listMapIds`, `purgeMapGrids`)
  binds its page size and offset as `?` parameters, exactly the shape `AbstractCommandSet`
  transcribes from upstream's Java. `connection.execute()` (mysql2's binary protocol,
  MySQL server-side prepare) fails this specific shape on real MySQL 8.4.6 with
  `ER_WRONG_ARGUMENTS` / "Incorrect arguments to mysqld_stmt_execute", regardless of the
  bound value's JS type; the identical driver, SQL text and params succeed unchanged
  against real MariaDB 11.4.7. `MySqlDriver.ts`'s `MySqlDriverAdapter` now sends every
  statement through `connection.query()` (mysql2's client-side value escaping — still not
  string concatenation, still safe against injection) instead of `execute()`, which fixed
  it on both dialects without changing a single SQL statement's text, preserving the
  byte-for-byte fidelity the `*CommandSet.test.ts` contract tests check. The blob
  byte-fidelity this switch might have put at risk was itself re-proven against the real
  server before trusting the fix.
- **Cross-compatibility with upstream's Java engine reading/writing the same database —
  proven, 2026-08-05 (`tools/oracle/sql-crosscompat.mjs`), issue #32's last open item.**
  Against a real `mariadb:11.4.7` server: upstream's own CLI rendered the standard
  1000×1000 oracle fixture straight into SQL storage and this port's `SQLStorage` read
  every tile and render-state grid back byte-identical (961/961 hires, 24/24 lowres, both
  metadata documents, and every deterministic render-state field — the wall-clock
  render/update timestamps aside, which two separate render runs cannot share and
  `diffRenderState` correctly excludes). This port's own engine then rendered the same
  fixture into a second SQL database, and upstream's real CLI, running genuinely
  webserver-only with no map ever loaded, served every one of those same tiles and
  documents back byte-identical over real HTTP through its production
  `MapStorageRequestHandler` raw-storage route. See `ROADMAP.md`'s Phase H section for the
  full numbers.
- **MariaDB Connector/J does not parse `jdbc:mariadb://user:password@host:port/db`
  embedded userinfo credentials** — it misreads the `password@host` segment as the port
  and fails with `SQLException: Incorrect port value`, confirmed against the real driver
  and a real server. `mysql2` (this port's own driver for the `mariadb`/`mysql` dialects)
  parses the identical URL shape correctly, so this is a genuine MariaDB Connector/J
  behavior the cross-compatibility harness had to route around — upstream's own
  `connection-properties` config field is exactly the documented escape hatch for it, so
  the harness's generated upstream config carries a bare connection URL plus
  `connection-properties` for credentials. No SQL storage code changed; this is a fact
  about the Java driver upstream leaves users to supply, not about the port.
- **SQLite and PostgreSQL are not cross-compatibility-proven the way MariaDB is.** They
  share every code path the MariaDB proof exercises
  (`SQLGridStorage`/`SQLItemStorage`/`AbstractCommandSet`), and both are independently
  proven against real same-engine servers already (`SqlStorage.realServer.test.ts` for
  PostgreSQL; the SQLite functional suite for SQLite) — but a genuine Java-CLI-vs-TS-port
  run has not been done for either. Upstream ships no bundled JDBC driver for SQLite any
  more than it does for MariaDB (`core/build.gradle.kts` depends on `commons-dbcp2` only),
  so proving SQLite this way would need the same `driver-jar`/`driver-class` treatment
  (e.g. `org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc`) MariaDB got here, not a shortcut.

## map/hires — the tile-model and the PRBM writer (Phase D wave 1)

The .prbm bytes this package writes are compared byte for byte against the Java writer's
output (see `packages/engine/src/map/hires/prbmOracleData.ts`, captured from
`vendor/BlueMap/implementations/cli/build/libs/cli-5.22-27-shadow.jar`), so the notes
below are all cases where the *shape* of the code differs while the numbers do not.

- **`ArrayTileModel`'s attribute arrays are typed arrays, and float expressions carry
  explicit `Math.fround`.** `float[]`/`byte[]`/`int[]` become
  `Float32Array`/`Int8Array`/`Int32Array`, so every store narrows exactly as Java's does.
  What a typed array cannot reproduce is Java rounding the *intermediate* results of a
  multi-operator float expression, so `transform` rounds after every operator and every
  `float` parameter is `Math.fround`ed on entry (Java narrowed it at the call site). This
  is not theoretical: the `floatIntermediates` oracle case exists because accumulating
  `m00*x + m01*y + m02*z` in double precision and narrowing once lands one ulp — one
  byte — away from what upstream emits.
- **`ArrayTileModel` has a field `size` and a method `size()`; javascript cannot.** The
  field is `_size`, the method keeps the upstream name. The attribute arrays are
  package-private upstream (PRBMWriter reads them directly) and are public-with-`@internal`
  here, since javascript has no package scope.
- **`ArrayTileModel.instancePool()` is created on first call**, not in a static
  initialiser, so importing the module does not arm the pool's auto-clear timer. The
  recycler's shrink logic (the `size / capacity > 1/1.5` check and the one-minute
  `lastCapacityUse` window) is unchanged. `util/InstancePool`'s timer is `unref`'d,
  because upstream's is a daemon thread and a pool used once must not keep a node process
  alive.
- **`PRBMWriter` writes into a growable buffer instead of wrapping an `OutputStream`.**
  Upstream is constructed around the storage layer's stream; the ported storage layer is
  buffer-oriented (see the `storage/ItemStorage` note above), so the writer accumulates
  and `getBytes()` hands the result over. `close()` is kept for API parity and does
  nothing. The byte counting the 4-byte attribute padding depends on is unchanged.
- **`TileModel`'s Java overloads-by-type collapse into unions or arity overloads.**
  `transform(int, int, MatrixM3f)` and `transform(int, int, MatrixM4f)` become one
  union-typed signature (both implementations dispatch on the runtime class anyway), and
  `invertOrientation(int)` vs. the interface-default `invertOrientation(int, int)` become
  arity overloads. Same for `TileModelView.initialize`'s four overloads.
- **`HiresModelManager` holds its render-passes as plain instance state, and saving is
  async.** Upstream keeps them in a `ThreadLocal` because it renders tiles on a thread
  pool; a javascript engine instance has one thread, so parallel tiles mean separate
  workers each with their own manager. `save` becomes "serialize to bytes, then await the
  storage write" for the same reason `PRBMWriter` does.
- **`RenderPass.render`'s `tileMetaConsumer` is an optional parameter** rather than a
  second interface-default overload; `NOOP_TILE_META_CONSUMER` is upstream's
  `(x, z, c, h, l) -> {}` lambda.

### flow-math's `TrigMath`, and the rest of the Java numerics

`ArrayTileModel.rotate`/`rotateXYZ`/`rotateZYX`/`rotateYXZ` — and, upstream, `MatrixM3f`,
`MatrixM4f`, `VectorM2f`, `LiquidModelRenderer` and `block/ResourceModelRenderer` — call
`com.flowpowered.math.TrigMath`, which quantises the angle into a 2^22-entry table of
`float`s. It is visibly coarser than libm: at a 7.5-degree half-angle its sine is 133 ulps
from `(float) Math.sin`, and `cos(pi/2)` comes back as 4.37e-8 rather than 6.12e-17. A port
that reached for `Math.sin` would emit different bytes for every rotated model.

The port of it lives in `@worldlens/shared` (`math/TrigMath.ts`), because the
matrices rotate with it too and there must only be one; its own deviations are recorded
with that package. `map/hires/ArrayTileModel.ts` imports it, and
`util/math/TrigMath.test.ts` pins the pairing the engine depends on — the exact half-angles
`rotate*` computes, and flow-math's sine and cosine for them — against values captured from
the oracle jar.

The remaining Java primitives are `util/math/JavaMath.ts`:

- **`toRadians` is a single multiply by `DEGREES_TO_RADIANS`**, which is what
  `java.lang.Math` has done since JDK 9 (JDK-8145213). The Java 8 form
  `angdeg / 180.0 * PI` differs by an ulp for some inputs — `toRadians(3)` and
  `toRadians(999.75)` among them — and the oracle jar runs on a modern JDK. The test
  pins all 26 reference half-angles against `Double.doubleToLongBits` of Java's own
  result, so this is proven rather than assumed.
- **`javaCastToInt` saturates rather than wrapping.** Javascript's `| 0` wraps modulo
  2^32 where Java's `(int)` narrowing clamps at `Integer.MIN_VALUE`/`MAX_VALUE` and maps
  NaN to 0. `PRBMWriter`'s normal encoding reaches that path on any degenerate
  (zero-area) face, where the normalisation divides by zero.
- **`floatToIntBits` collapses NaN to `0x7fc00000`**, which is what separates
  `Float.floatToIntBits` from `floatToRawIntBits`; reinterpreting a `Float32Array` through
  an `Int32Array` gives the raw form and would leak a NaN payload into the file.

## util/math (shared) — 32-bit float arithmetic and flow-math trigonometry

Upstream's `Color`, `VectorM2f`, `VectorM3f`, `MatrixM3f` and `MatrixM4f` are `float`
throughout, and their rotations call **`com.flowpowered.math.TrigMath`**, not
`java.lang.Math`. Both facts are load-bearing for the mesher, and both were reproduced
here only after the reference implementation was run and its numbers compared: with
double arithmetic and `Math.sin`, 30 of the 52 liquid uv-transform values differed from
the jar's, and `MatrixM4f#rotateYXZ` — which `blockstate/Variant` and `model/Rotation`
bake every rotated model with — was wrong by ~25 float-ulps at every angle.

- **`Math.fround` marks every point java rounds to 32 bits.** A double intermediate
  rounded only once at the end is a different float often enough to move a vertex. Where
  upstream mixes widths the port follows exactly: `VectorM3f#lengthSquared` computes in
  float and returns a double, and `VectorM2f#angleTo` divides a float numerator by a
  double denominator before narrowing the `acos` result.
- **`TrigMath`'s 2^22-entry sine table is evaluated on demand rather than materialized.**
  Upstream fills `float[4194304]` in a static initializer with
  `SIN_TABLE[i] = (float) Math.sin(i * TWO_PI / SIN_SIZE)`; this port evaluates that same
  expression for the single index a call needs. Identical by construction, and it saves a
  permanently-resident 16 MB `Float32Array`.
- **`Math.sin` is assumed to agree with java's to within a double-ulp.** Both are
  fdlibm-derived and faithfully rounded, and a disagreement only survives the narrowing to
  float when the double lands within one double-ulp of a float boundary (~2^-29 per
  index). Pinned against the real table in `flowMathOracle.test.ts`.
- **`Math.toRadians` is duplicated in `shared` rather than imported from
  `engine/util/math/JavaMath`,** because `shared` can not depend on `engine`. Both carry
  the JDK 9+ single-multiply form (JDK-8145213); the java 8 form disagrees at `-337.5`,
  `-247.5`, `-168.75` and `-123.75`, all ordinary model rotations, and there the ulp lands
  on a different sine-table entry.
- **Open gap: `Vector3f` and `Vector4f` still store doubles.** They are immutable holders
  for json-parsed model values (`from`, `to`, `uv`), so the difference only bites if a
  pack writes a coordinate that is not exactly representable as a float. The block mesher
  narrows them with `Math.fround` where it reads them; the classes themselves are left for
  whichever wave owns them.
- The shared math tests were retargeted from double precision to float precision as part
  of this: assertions that read `toBeCloseTo(x, 9)` were asserting an accuracy the ported
  classes must *not* have.

## map/hires/block (the block mesher)

- **Caffeine `LoadingCache` becomes `lru-cache`,** with upstream's `Caches.build`
  parameters (`maximumSize(10000)`, `expireAfterAccess(1 minute)`) — the same substitution
  `resources/pack/resourcepack/ResourcePack` already makes. `BlockStateModelRenderer`'s and
  `MissingModelRenderer`'s renderer caches are keyed by the `BlockRendererType` object,
  which caffeine also compares by identity since that type overrides neither `equals` nor
  `hashCode`. `MissingModelRenderer`'s static `BlockState`-keyed cache is keyed by the
  block-state's canonical `id[sorted properties]` string instead, because a javascript Map
  compares by identity where java's compares by `equals`/`hashCode`.
- **`RenderSettings`' interface-defaults live on a companion object.** The abstract
  members stay on the interface — which is what a defaulted java method looks like to a
  caller — and the default *bodies* (`isRenderEdges`, `getEdgeLightStrength`,
  `isIgnoreMissingLightData`, the three `isInsideRenderBoundaries` overloads and
  `getCellRenderBoundariesFilter`) sit on `export const RenderSettings`, the shape this
  port already uses for `BlockColorCalculator` and `MapSettings`. The boundary tests are
  pure functions of `getRenderMask`, so they are *only* on the companion and callers write
  `RenderSettings.isInsideRenderBoundaries(settings, x, z)`.
- **`ResourceModelRenderer`'s two `getRotationRelativeBlock` overloads collapse into one.**
  Upstream's `(Direction)` overload delegates through a `(Vector3i)` one that nothing else
  calls with a raw vector.
- **`buildModelElementResource`'s `blockModel` parameter is dropped** in favour of the
  field it shadows. Upstream passes `blockModel.initialize()`, which returns the very same
  view object, so the two are always identical.
- **`| 0` folds javascript's `-0` back onto the int `0` java would have produced,** at the
  three places a negation or a modulo can produce it: the face-rotation step count
  (`Math.floorDiv(-360, 90) % 4`), `LiquidModelRenderer`'s flowing angle when the angle is
  zero, and the `Math.round` of a rotation-relative neighbour offset. Only the first
  changes behaviour — `rawUvs[-0]` is `undefined` where `rawUvs[0]` is a vector — but all
  three are folded so the values stay java ints.
- **A model's element array is `(Element | null)[]` here and `Element[]` upstream,**
  because a json `null` element survives this port's parser. The renderer skips a null
  element; upstream would throw, so no pack that renders at all can reach the difference.
- **`testHarness.ts` is a port addition** — a hand-built world and resource-pack so the
  block renderers can be driven without a Minecraft installation, in the same spirit as
  `resources/pack/vfs/zipTestUtil.ts`.

### map/mask, map/lowres, map/renderstate and map/hires/entity (Wave D-3)

- **`Mask`'s two interface-defaults live on a companion object.** `submask` and `inverted`
  stay required members of the `Mask` interface — which is what a defaulted java method
  looks like to a caller — while their bodies sit on `export const Mask` as
  `Mask.submask(mask, …)` / `Mask.inverted(mask)`, the same shape the port already uses for
  `RenderSettings` and `BlockColorCalculator`. Every concrete mask delegates to them in a
  one-line member. `Mask.ALL` is spelled `new InvertedMask(NONE)` rather than
  `NONE.inverted()`, because at that point in module evaluation the companion holding the
  default body is still in its temporal dead zone; the resulting object is the same one
  upstream's `NONE.inverted()` produces, and `Mask.ALL.inverted() === Mask.NONE` still
  holds.
- **The overloaded `test` / `testXZ` methods become arity-dispatched implementations.**
  Java overloads `test(int,int,int)` against `test(int,int,int,int,int,int)` and (in
  `EllipseMask`/`PolygonMask`) `testXZ(x,z)` against `testXZ(minX,minZ,maxX,maxZ)`; all
  parameters are numbers, so TypeScript declares the call-signatures and one implementation
  branching on whether the later arguments were passed.
- **`PolygonMask` declares its own minimal `Shape`.** Upstream takes
  `de.bluecolored.bluemap.api.math.Shape`; the BlueMapAPI artifact is not part of the
  engine port and the mask only reads `getPoints()`, so the file exports a
  `{ getPoints(): readonly Vector2d[] }` seam. There is no `CircleMask` upstream — a circle
  is `EllipseMask`'s four-argument constructor.
- **`BlurMask.randomOffset` runs on `BigInt`.** Its `long` hash is the same 64-bit shape as
  `VariantSet.hashToFloat` and `block/ResourceModelRenderer.hashToFloat`, so it uses the
  same transcription with `BigInt.asIntN(64, …)` at every point java wraps, and
  `Math.fround` on the float steps after the 24-bit mask. Its offsets are pinned in
  `map/mask/Mask.test.ts` against values produced by running the upstream expression on a
  JDK.
- **The three `SHIFT` constants move from the `Map*State` classes to their region types.**
  Upstream `TileInfoRegion` statically imports `MapTileState.SHIFT` while `MapTileState`
  extends `CellStorage`, which the port must import the region types into (to register
  their nbt-schemas). Keeping the java direction would make the ES module graph cyclic at
  class-extends time, so `SHIFT` is declared in `TileInfoRegion` / `ChunkInfoRegion` /
  `RegionInfoRegion` and re-exported as `MapTileState.SHIFT` / `MapChunkState.SHIFT` /
  `MapRegionState.SHIFT`, so the upstream name still resolves.
- **`TileActionResolver.ActionAndNextState`'s six statics are built lazily.** Upstream's
  `static final` fields are initialized from `TileState`'s constants while those constants
  are built from these — a cycle java resolves through class-initialization order and an ES
  module would hit in the temporal dead zone. They are `get` accessors that construct once
  and cache, so they stay the singletons upstream's reference comparisons rely on. The
  record's canonical constructor is reachable as `ActionAndNextState.Impl`.
- **The region types' nbt fields are public and carry an explicit `ObjectSchema`.** Upstream
  reads them through BlueNBT's field-reflection over `@NBTName`/`@NBTPostDeserialize`; the
  port's BlueNBT takes a spelled-out schema, which can only name public members. Same shape
  and same reason as the already-ported `LevelData`. `modified` stays out of the schema,
  exactly as `transient` keeps it out upstream.
- **`CellStorage` is asynchronous and its cache is hand-rolled.** Every storage access
  returns a promise (the compression layer decompresses asynchronously), so `cell`, `save`,
  `forEachCell` and the `Map*State` accessors do too. Upstream's access-ordered
  `LinkedHashMap` with a `removeEldestEntry` override becomes a `Map` keyed by the cell
  position's string form (a javascript Map keys objects by identity, upstream relies on
  `Vector2i`'s value-equality) plus an explicit re-insert on access and one eviction check
  per insert.
- **`CellStorage.forEach` is renamed `forEachCell`,** because `MapRegionState` *overloads*
  it with a public `forEach(RegionStateConsumer)` and TypeScript can not tell two
  function-typed parameters apart at runtime. Upstream's package-private one has exactly
  one caller.
- **`CellStorage#loadCell` splits its catch by *where* the failure happened,** not by
  exception type. Upstream logs an `IOException` and moves on, but treats a
  `RuntimeException` (BlueNBT's format errors) as a corrupt file and deletes it for
  self-healing; javascript has no such distinction, so the read and the decode sit in
  separate `try` blocks and only a decode failure deletes.
- **`LowresTile` is a pngjs `PNG`, not a `BufferedImage`,** the same substitution the
  resource-pack texture layer already makes: both are 8-bit straight-alpha RGBA, so
  `getRGB`/`setRGB` map across directly, and `save()` returns the encoded bytes instead of
  writing to an `OutputStream`. Upstream's `ReentrantReadWriteLock` has no counterpart.
  `getHeight`'s sign-extension is kept bug-for-bug: upstream tests `height > 0x8000` rather
  than `>=`, so the single value whose 16-bit form is exactly `0x8000` reads back positive.
- **`LowresLayer` keeps one `lru-cache` where upstream keeps two caffeine caches.** The
  weak-valued cache exists to guarantee that only one instance of a tile exists while
  anything still references it; javascript has neither soft references nor a
  deterministically readable weak-valued cache, so the port consults `pendingChanges`
  first — which is the only thing that holds a tile alive between a write and its save, and
  therefore exactly the case the weak cache is there for — and falls back to a size- and
  time-bounded `lru-cache` in front of storage.
- **`LowresTileManager.set` queues.** Upstream's is synchronous and `LowresTileManager
  implements TileMetaConsumer`; here storage is asynchronous while a render-pass calls the
  consumer from a synchronous loop. So `set` snapshots the colour (a render-pass hands over
  one reused scratch instance per column — upstream mutates it to straight and never reads
  it again, so the snapshot is unobservable), chains the write behind the previous one so
  cells land in call order, and returns the tail. Calling it and dropping the promise is
  therefore safe, which is how `BmMap` wires it; `save`/`discard` drain the queue first, and
  `tileMetaConsumer()` hands out the function-shape upstream's `implements` gave it.
- **`RenderPass#render` may return a promise, and `HiresModelManager` awaits it.** Upstream
  returns `void`; `EntityRenderPass` can not, because the port's `World#iterateEntities`
  reads the entity chunks from disk asynchronously. `BlockRenderPass` still returns
  synchronously.
- **`entity/ResourceModelRenderer`'s package-private `render(…, Model, TintColorProvider,
  …)` overload is renamed `renderModel`.** Java overloads it against the public
  `render(…, Part, …)` by parameter type, which TypeScript can not do for two plain objects.
  `TintColorProvider` splits into an interface plus a same-named const holding `NO_TINT`.
- **`entity/EntityModelRenderer` and `entity/MissingModelRenderer` use `lru-cache`** with
  caffeine's `Caches.build` bounds (maximum size 10000, one-minute idle expiry).
  `MissingModelRenderer`'s static entity-type cache is keyed by the key's formatted string
  because a javascript Map keys objects by identity; the per-type renderer cache is keyed by
  the `EntityRendererType` object, which caffeine also compares by identity.
- **`EntityRendererType`'s factories load their renderer class through a thunk.**
  `MissingModelRenderer` imports this module back for `REGISTRY`/`DEFAULT`, so the two
  constructor references are `() => ResourceModelRenderer` / `() => MissingModelRenderer`,
  evaluated when the factory is *called* rather than at module scope.
- **Upstream's missing null-checks are kept.** `entity/ResourceModelRenderer.render`
  dereferences an unresolvable part model and `EntityModelRenderer.render` dereferences an
  entity-state with no `parts` member; both throw a `NullPointerException` upstream and a
  `TypeError` here, at the same statement.

## Server package (`packages/server`)

### Deliberate additions (no upstream equivalent)

- **`POST /maps/{id}/update` and `GET /maps/{id}/update`
  (`src/http/RenderUpdateHandler.ts`, driven by `src/render/RenderDriver.ts`).** Upstream's
  web server is read-only: every route `MapRequestHandler` and its siblings serve is a GET
  over `MapStorage`, and a real BlueMap instance starts an update from a plugin command
  (`/bluemap update`) or a file-system watch, never from an HTTP request — there is no
  upstream file this route ports. Material BlueMap's desktop app *is* the server, though,
  so "ask the server to render now" needs an entry point, and this is it. What happens once
  asked is not invented: `RenderDriver.triggerUpdate` calls the same
  `MapUpdatePreparationTask.updateMap(BmMap, RenderManager)` a plugin command calls, so
  region discovery, task construction and scheduling all stay in `packages/engine`. The
  route itself — the URL shape, the `POST` triggers / `GET` reads status / other methods
  405, `?force=force_all|force_edge|force_none` mapping to `TileUpdateStrategy`, 404 for an
  unregistered map id — is this port's own design, documented in
  `src/render/RenderDriver.ts`'s module doc-comment. Covered by
  `packages/server/test/render-driver.test.ts`'s `RenderUpdateHandler` describe block.

### Queue-priority parity

- **Interactive trigger priority follows upstream, with active-head protection.** Issue #68
  selects the smallest typed `schedule-next` path for interactive `RenderDriver` triggers, matching
  upstream's queue-priority behavior without displacing the task currently at the head. The new
  work is inserted after the active task and may therefore run before already queued region work;
  ordinary scheduling remains tail-enqueue. This is an intentional API-visible scheduling choice,
  not a porting accident, and the active task's existing cancellation, containment, and progress
  semantics remain in force.

### Bug fixes / API-visible changes

- **`SseConnectionManager.open()` calls `res.flushHeaders()` before registering the
  connection** (`src/live/SseConnectionManager.ts:122-140`). Upstream's Java `HttpServer`
  sends the SSE response headers the moment `MapRequestHandler` hands back an
  `HttpResponse`, independent of whether the attached body stream has produced a byte yet —
  so a client's `EventSource` reliably sees `open` as soon as it connects, whether it is the
  first listener or the fifth. Node's `http.ServerResponse` buffers headers until the first
  `write()`/`end()` by default, so without an explicit flush a second, third, ... connection
  that joins after the manager's empty→non-empty transition (the point where
  `LiveDataBroadcaster` would normally start pushing) sees nothing at all until the next
  broadcast happens to write bytes — for a quiet map, that can be indefinitely. The port
  calls `res.flushHeaders()` immediately after `writeHead()`, restoring upstream's
  "headers land on connect" guarantee for a runtime that does not give it for free. No
  upstream file or line corresponds to this fix; it exists only because Node's transport
  behaves differently from upstream's.
