# Design decisions (ADR summary)

Decisions locked during planning (see `../../plan.md` for full context):

- **D1 — NBT**: hand-rolled `@worldlens/nbt` mirroring BlueNBT's adapter model
  (lazy/streaming reads on the chunk hot path, writer for renderstate/tasks.dat).
  `PackedIntArrayAccess` bit math on 32-bit halves; no per-block BigInt.
- **D2 — Compression**: gzip/deflate via `node:zlib`; zstd via `@bokuweb/zstd-wasm`;
  LZ4 = port of lz4-java **block** framing (`LZ4Block` magic, token, lengths, xxhash32)
  over `lz4js` — required for MC 1.20.5+ regions and `bluemap:lz4` storage compression.
- **D3 — Raster**: `pngjs` everywhere (texture decode, atlas ops, lowres encode, skins).
  PNG parity checked on decoded pixels, never bytes.
- **D4 — Render pool**: `worker_threads`, baked resource pack shared via SharedArrayBuffer,
  workers return PRBM bytes + lowres patches as transferables, host does all storage writes.
- **D5 — Mesh**: `ArrayTileModel` as SoA typed arrays; `PRBMWriter` byte-identical to Java.
- **D6 — Caching**: `lru-cache` with explicit byte budgets replacing Caffeine soft refs.
- **D7 — Zip**: `yauzl-promise` behind a VFS abstraction (dir/zip transparent).
- **D8 — Mojang assets**: runtime download (SHA-1 verified) after explicit consent; never bundled.
- **D9 — Config**: HOCON read-compat (`hocon-parser`) for upstream config dirs; app-native
  JSON validated by zod; locales stay HOCON.
- **D10 — Serving**: one ported HTTP server everywhere; Electron loads `http://127.0.0.1:<random>`
  with a per-launch token; same server backs `cli -w`.
- **D11 — Remote mode**: local reverse proxy `/remote/{profile}/…` (remote BlueMap servers
  send no CORS headers); gates remote scripts/styles default-deny.
- **D12 — Processes**: Electron main thin; engine+server in a `utilityProcess`; renderer
  sandboxed (contextIsolation, no nodeIntegration); typed preload bridge.
- **D13 — Security**: strict CSP, DOMPurify for marker HTML, popup onclick rewritten,
  navigation locked, electron-store persistence.
- **D14 — UI kit**: Vuetify 3 `md3` blueprint + `--md-sys-color-*` token bridge (tokens also
  style the viewer's raw-DOM markers); dark/light/contrast themes.
- **D15 — Config schema**: one zod schema in `shared` covers every upstream option with UI
  metadata; MD3 forms generated from it; serializes JSON⇄HOCON (drives upstream Java servers too).
- **D16 — Docker hosting**: `dockerode`; instance = container + managed volumes + ports;
  image selectable (ported image default, upstream `ghcr.io/bluemap-minecraft/bluemap` supported).

## D20 — Keep render-queue persistence engine-owned until a process owner is wired

**Recorded 2026-08-19 for issue #64.** `RenderManager` in `packages/engine` owns the
serialisation boundary (`saveRenderTaskQueue` / `loadRenderTaskQueue`). The
`packages/server` `RenderQueuePersistence` helper owns the process-boundary policy when
constructed: 30-second periodic requests by default, coalesced saves, unique staging names,
atomic replacement, terminal-task filtering, and a final shutdown save. The standalone CLI
now constructs it after maps are built, using `<resolved core.data>/tasks.dat`; the server
package exports the helper but has no separate construction site. The desktop app's local
Java-render path is not an owner of this TypeScript queue.

The current API accepts a caller-supplied absolute queue-file path. The CLI supplies
`<resolved core.data>/tasks.dat`; the focused storage tests use a file named `tasks.dat` in a
temporary directory. The queue format is version `1`, a BlueNBT `TasksData` object with
`version` and `render-tasks` fields. Unknown versions
or an unreadable top-level file are refused and discarded; an unknown task type or missing
map drops only that entry and preserves the other valid entries.

The storage primitive writes through a sibling `.filepart` and atomic move; the server helper
adds a unique `*.staging-<uuid>` path and prevents overlapping helper saves by scheduling one
follow-up pass. It filters tasks whose `hasMoreWork()` is false before saving, which is the
current terminal-task non-resurrection measure, but it is not yet a proof against every stale
queue or crash-ordering race. There is no retention history beyond the CLI's one current
`tasks.dat` file. The CLI loads after map construction and logs map-build skips, while queue
entry failures use the error callback; a structured skipped-task/recovery surface is not yet
proven. A real restart proof remains outstanding.

## D17 — Java engine first for local rendering, TypeScript mesher as its replacement

**Decided 2026-08-03, superseding the pure-TypeScript renderer position in D5.**

Local world rendering runs upstream BlueMap's Java renderer, built from the vendored source at
`vendor/BlueMap` and driven by the app. The TypeScript mesher in `packages/engine` continues to
be written and replaces it once it proves byte-identical output.

**Why.** D5 committed to a pure TypeScript mesher with no JVM. That decision is sound for the end
state and wrong for the interval: until the mesher is finished the app cannot render anything at
all, and the mesher is the largest and highest-risk part of the whole port. Driving upstream's
renderer means a world can be rendered now, and it gives the mesher an exact oracle to be checked
against rather than an approximation that looks plausible.

**What this costs, stated rather than hidden.** A JDK becomes a requirement for local rendering.
There are two rendering paths to maintain and test until the mesher lands. The project's headline
claim of being JVM-free becomes conditional, and the README says so rather than implying
otherwise.

**How the mesher takes over.** The same gate Phase D always had: decompressed PRBM bytes
identical to the Java engine's, and lowres PNGs identical pixel for pixel, across every fixture
world. Nothing switches silently; the application states which engine rendered a map.

**Consequences.**
- The Java toolchain is provisioned into a repository-local, gitignored directory, so no
  machine-wide toolchain is touched. See issue #3.
- The oracle harness that D5 deferred is no longer optional infrastructure: it is the same build
  the product uses, so it is exercised continuously rather than only when someone remembers.
- The options GUI is unblocked ahead of schedule. It writes BlueMap's own HOCON configuration and
  invokes the CLI, so it no longer waits for the TypeScript render manager in Phase E.

**Amendment, 2026-08-05 — the gate closed; the "until" is retired.** The Phase D parity gate
described above closed on 2026-08-04: `tools/oracle/compare.mjs` reported a generated
1000x1000 world byte-identical between the two engines (995 files matched, 961/961 hires
tiles equal after decompression, 24/24 lowres tiles equal pixel for pixel), and a 200x200
fixture on a different seed reported the same. That closes the condition this decision
originally wrote as "until it proves byte-identical output" — and the decision is amended
rather than superseded, because the answer is not "so it switches now."

The Java engine remains the default by a standing decision of 2026-08-05, not by the gate
being open. Nothing above this paragraph is rewritten: D17 was decided for the interval
before the gate closed, and it correctly drove that interval. What changes here is what
happens *after* the gate closes, which the original text left as "the mesher takes over."
It does not. The TypeScript mesher becomes the default only through a later, separately
verified switch decision — its own evidence, its own date, its own number — never as a
side effect of the oracle going green. `upstreamJavaEngine` is pinned as the production
`resolveEngine` by a named test beside the orchestrator's own
(`packages/app/src/main/render/engine.test.ts`), so that a future switch has to edit an
assertion on purpose rather than happen as drift in the wiring.

**Why amend instead of leaving it implicit.** A gate that closes and a product that
silently starts using the thing it gated is the switch nobody decided. The oracle proves
the mesher's *output*; it says nothing about operational readiness, rollout risk, or
whether anyone has verified the switch itself end to end. Closing the gate was Phase D's
job. Deciding to flip the default is a different, still-unmade decision, and this
amendment makes the gap between the two explicit instead of leaving a stale "until" for
the next reader to trip over.

## D18 — Port every implementation, including the six platform adapters

**Decided 2026-08-03, superseding exclusions S2 and S4 in `plan.md`.**

Everything upstream ships is ported, including the Spigot, Paper, Fabric, Forge, NeoForge and
Sponge adapters and the Java addon loader, which the plan had excluded as meaningless outside a
Minecraft server JVM.

Since D17 puts a real JVM in the product, those adapters are no longer inert: the same build that
produces the renderer produces them, and a user running a Minecraft server can take the plugin
for their platform from the same release. What was excluded as unusable is now a shipping
artifact.

## D21 — Retire the unreachable local `WebServer`; `LocalMapHandler` is the serving path

**Decided 2026-08-19.**

The local `packages/app/src/main/runtime/webserver.ts` `WebServer` class is retired. It started
the upstream engine a second time with `-w`, wrote a web-server configuration, and waited for a
TCP connection before reporting a URL. It had no production caller: the only local construction
was in its own test, and renderer/preload exposed no start, stop or status route. The
`role: "web-server"` plan used by remote hosting is a separate SSH pipeline and is not evidence
of a local caller.

The existing local route is canonical. The embedded `HttpServer` mounts `LocalMapHandler` at
`/local/{renderId}/...`; `render/orchestrator.ts` mounts completed output for both local and
Docker execution. A rendered map is a static web root once the engine has written it, so a
second JVM, local `-w` port, bind probe, restart/reattach path and repair contract would add
machinery without adding a reachable product capability. The app therefore makes no local
promise to start upstream's live web server or report a local `-w` URL.

`WebServer`, its source and tests, and the runtime re-export are removed. Shared launch-planning
types, Docker publish fields and repair evidence values remain where remote hosting still needs
them; they are not a reachable local surface. If a future feature needs an upstream live server,
it must first name a production owner, lifetime, UI/IPC route, restart/repair contract and real
port-readiness evidence.

**Reference inventory.** Obsolete/local: `runtime/webserver.ts` and its dedicated test, the
runtime barrel export, the web-server-started annotation and console copy, and local `-w`, port,
and readiness promises. Preserved remote/shared: `RuntimeRole` and engine `-w` planning types used
by remote hosting, Docker publish fields, `RepairSubject` `web-server` evidence for remote hosting,
`remote/hostplan.ts`, `remote/hosting.ts` and their tests, `LocalMapHandler`, and the embedded and
preview servers.

廣東話：本機 `WebServer` 冇 production caller；local、Docker、remote、IPC 同 preload 都冇真正
開過佢。Remote hosting 嘅 `role: "web-server"` 係另一條 SSH 路，唔可以當成本機已經有人用。
現時正路係 embedded `HttpServer` 加 `LocalMapHandler`，render 完就直接當 static web root
讀，唔使多開 JVM、多守一個 port、或者扮有一個 local `-w` URL 等人驗收。今次刪 class 同
stale local promise；將來要 live upstream server，就要先有真正 caller、生命週期、UI/IPC、
診斷同 port-ready 證據。

**參考清單。** 已過時／本機：`runtime/webserver.ts` 同佢專用嘅 test、runtime barrel
export、web-server-started annotation 同 console copy，仲有本機 `-w`、port 同 readiness
promise。保留嘅 remote／共用項目：remote hosting 會用到嘅 `RuntimeRole` 同 engine `-w`
planning types、Docker publish fields、remote hosting 用嘅 `RepairSubject` `web-server`
evidence、`remote/hostplan.ts`、`remote/hosting.ts` 同佢哋嘅 tests、`LocalMapHandler`，以及
embedded 同 preview servers。

## D19 — Project CI moved to self-hosted runners; `pull_request` dropped from `ci.yml`

**Decided 2026-08-05.**

`ci.yml`, `pages.yml` and `build-jars.yml` — the workflows that build and test **this repository
itself** — now run on two of this developer's own machines, registered as GitHub Actions
self-hosted runners (`CLAUDE`, labelled `self-hosted, Linux, X64`, and `CLAUDE-Windows`, labelled
`self-hosted, X64, Windows`), targeted by their label sets rather than `ubuntu-latest` /
`windows-latest`. This is scoped to this project's own CI only. The render templates this
application commits into *users'* own repositories — `render-world.yml`, `render-shard-wave.yml`,
`render-private-world.yml`, `scheduled-render.yml` — stay on GitHub-hosted runners; pointing a
user's render queue at a runner only this developer owns would break rendering for everyone else
the moment this developer's machine is offline, and was never the intent of this change.

This repository is public, and a self-hosted runner on a public repository is a documented attack
path: anyone who can cause a workflow to run can execute code on the machine behind it. `ci.yml`
therefore no longer triggers on `pull_request` — that trigger is exactly the one reachable by
anyone who can open a PR, including from a fork with arbitrary workflow content, without needing
write access to this repository. `push` and `workflow_dispatch` both require write access, which
is the actual mitigation; see the trigger comment at the top of `ci.yml` for the fuller version.
`pages.yml` and `build-jars.yml` were audited for the same problem and found already clean: both
were already gated to `push`/`workflow_call`/`workflow_dispatch` with no `pull_request` trigger.

Two consequences follow directly and are handled in the workflows themselves rather than by a
separate document:

- **Nothing is preinstalled.** GitHub's hosted images arrive with Node, Java, pnpm, `shellcheck`,
  `zip`/`unzip` and `xvfb` already on them; a self-hosted machine has whatever it happens to have.
  Every changed job now installs what it needs — Node and pnpm at the exact versions
  `design/package.json` pins (`engines.node` and `packageManager`), Temurin where a job already
  needed Java, and a check-first, install-only-if-missing step for `shellcheck`, `zip`, `unzip`
  and `xvfb` where a job's existing steps assumed the hosted image's toolset. `shellcheck`
  installs into a per-job directory added to `PATH` with no `sudo`; the OS-packaged tools
  (`zip`/`unzip`/`xvfb`) go through `apt-get`, which does need `sudo` on this machine and is
  flagged as such at each call site — the genuinely canonical distribution channel for an OS
  utility, unlike a tool with its own upstream binary releases.
- **The workspace is not clean between runs.** `actions/checkout@v4`'s default `clean: true`
  (`git clean -ffdx && git reset --hard HEAD`) already wipes untracked and ignored files — stray
  `node_modules`, build output — from the checked-out tree at the start of every job, which covers
  most of this. What it does not cover: state outside `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` (a stuck Electron
  process from a crashed capture, a stale Xvfb display), which the `screenshots` job now clears
  defensively at the start of its own run rather than assuming a fresh machine.

Tonight's push burst also queued 26 simultaneous runs against these same two machines — harmless
on free, disposable hosted runners, a real pileup against two real computers. `ci.yml` gained a
`concurrency` block on every job except `release` (`cancel-in-progress: true`, keyed per job on
`github.ref`), so a burst of pushes cancels each job's own stale predecessor rather than queuing
all of them. This is deliberately **not** a single workflow-level group: `ci.yml` tried that once
before (see the comment above `permissions:` in that file) and a shared group evicted queued runs
in a way that left long stretches of `main` with no verdict at all. `release` keeps its
pre-existing job-level group (`cancel-in-progress: false`) untouched — a queued publish should
wait, never be dropped, and a workflow-level group could have cancelled a release job mid-publish,
which is exactly the failure this decision must not reintroduce.

**Follow-up, 2026-08-06: `build-jars.yml`'s `jars` job failed every run on the new self-hosted
runner**, deterministically, on the `:forge` shadow jar. ForgeGradle 7 (the plugin behind that one
module) needs its own JDK 8 to run its build-time tools (the old MCP/AT tooling), separate from the
JavaLanguageVersion 25 the project itself compiles under. When ForgeGradle cannot find a JDK 8
already installed, it downloads one itself through a bundled "Disco" (foojay) client into its own
Gradle cache — and on this runner's container image, the downloaded tarball's `bin/java` fails to
even start: `error while loading shared libraries: libjli.so: cannot open shared object file`.
`libjli.so` ships inside the JDK archive itself, so the file is not missing; the dynamic loader
cannot resolve it via the JDK's own RPATH, which on this stripped image means the base
shared-library set that path points at isn't there. This never showed up before the self-hosted
move because GitHub's hosted images carry that base library set; it is exactly the kind of
"nothing is preinstalled" gap the bullet list above was written for, just one layer deeper than
`shellcheck`/`zip`/`xvfb` — a JDK a *build plugin* provisions for itself, not one this workflow
asks for directly.

Two fixes were available: chase down and install whatever base libraries the stripped image is
missing so the *downloaded* JDK 8 can run, or make ForgeGradle never need to download one at all.
The second is what shipped, because it does not depend on this specific container image's package
set staying the same, and because a properly-installed JDK is cached by the runner between runs
where a re-downloaded one is thrown away. `build-jars.yml`'s `build` job now installs a Temurin JDK
8 with `actions/setup-java` *before* its existing JDK 25 install (installing second is what keeps
`JAVA_HOME` — and therefore the JVM that launches Gradle itself — on 25, unchanged from before), and
passes `-Dorg.gradle.java.installations.fromEnv=JAVA_HOME_8_X64,JAVA_HOME_25_X64` on the `./gradlew`
invocation. That system property is Gradle's own mechanism for naming environment variables that
point at real JDK installs; `actions/setup-java` exports exactly such a variable
(`JAVA_HOME_<version>_X64`) for every JDK it installs in a job. ForgeGradle's own toolchain lookup
is built on that same Gradle installation registry, so once a real JDK 8 is a registered
installation, ForgeGradle finds it there and its Disco-download path — the one that was failing —
never runs. Nothing in `vendor/BlueMap` was touched: doing so would mark the vendored checkout
dirty and stamp every jar's version with a `-dirty` suffix (see the "Resolve the upstream version"
step in `build-jars.yml`), so the fix lives entirely in the workflow's own `-D` flag and installed
toolchains. The rest of `ci.yml` and `pages.yml` were re-audited at the same time for the same class
of "assumed the hosted image" failure and found already covered by the bullet list above; no other
job invokes a build plugin that provisions its own JDK.

The user separately authorised a scoped fallback for the `jars` job specifically, if the fix above
does not hold after a genuine attempt on the real runner: move `runs-on` for that one job only back
to `ubuntu-latest`, leaving every other job on the self-hosted labels. That fallback is not taken
unless the pushed fix is actually observed failing on the runner - this paragraph exists so the
condition and its scope are recorded before, not after, that observation.

**Same follow-up: `ci.yml`'s `screenshots` job's `Install Playwright browsers` step was already
flagged above (bullet list, "Nothing is preinstalled") as calling `apt-get`, with `sudo`,
unconditionally on every run - a known gap left for later because, at the time, Playwright's own
`install-deps` command does not check current system state before running `apt-get update && apt-get
install`. The later fix is not "skip it sometimes" but a genuine, cheap, self-updating check ahead of
it: `playwright install-deps chromium --dry-run` is an official, documented Playwright CLI mode that
touches nothing and simulates the install via `apt-get install -s` against whatever package list
*this installed Playwright version* currently requires, exiting non-zero the instant one package is
missing. Because that requirement list is recomputed from the live Playwright version on every run
rather than copied into this workflow once, a future Playwright upgrade that needs one more library
than this machine has is caught correctly - the dry run reports it missing, the real `install-deps`
step (gated on the dry run's result) runs and installs it. Any dry-run failure, for that reason or
any other, is treated as "not confirmed satisfied" and falls through to the real install, so the
check can only ever skip work it has verified is unnecessary, never the reverse.

**Same follow-up, 2026-08-06 (second incident): the `screenshots` job still failed after the
Playwright dry-run fix above landed**, this time with all 24 screenshot tests gated on one failing
`electron.launch()` in `beforeAll` and never running. The run's summary truncated the useful line
(`[pid=249620][err] ...electron: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-3.so.0: ...` cut off
mid-path), so the first step was pulling the untruncated job log with `gh api
repos/<repo>/actions/jobs/<id>/logs` rather than guessing between this project's two previously-seen
causes of the same misleading `exitCode=127` (a never-downloaded Electron binary, and a missing
shared library). The full line was:

```
error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-3.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Confirmed as the missing-library cause, not the missing-binary one: the process had already been
assigned a pid before it died, so the binary itself was present and executable. The library it
wanted is real and simply never gets installed by anything already in this job - `playwright
install-deps chromium` (the step directly above in `ci.yml`) only computes Chromium's own dependency
list, and Electron's *own* main process links against GTK for native dialogs and the tray icon,
which is a dependency Chromium alone does not have and Playwright's dry run therefore never reports
missing. `ci.yml` gained a second check-first, install-only-if-missing step right after the Playwright
one: `ldconfig -p | grep -q libgtk-3.so.0` (the correct check for a *shared library* rather than an
executable, unlike `command -v` used elsewhere in this file), installing `libgtk-3-0t64` with a
fallback to the pre-transition `libgtk-3-0` if that fails - this runner's Debian trixie renamed the
package with a "t64" suffix as part of its 64-bit time_t transition, the same pattern already visible
in the Chromium-deps package list (`libatk1.0-0t64`, `libasound2t64`, `libcups2t64`).

Three other things were checked in the same pass and found *not* to need changing, recorded here so
nobody re-investigates them:

- **The `unzip`/`xvfb-run` presence check's condition is correct, not inverted.**
  `command -v xvfb-run >/dev/null 2>&1 || missing+=(xvfb)` appends to `missing` only when the command
  is *absent* (non-zero exit), and the job log for this same failing run shows `xvfb` actually being
  installed - "installing: xvfb (requires sudo on this self-hosted runner)" - so the probe was doing
  its job. This was not the bug.
- **A defensive check for the *other* known cause (the Electron binary never having been downloaded
  at all, hit before on this project via npm/pnpm's install-script gate) was added anyway**, as a
  step right after `pnpm install` that resolves `require('electron')` - the same resolution
  `_electron.launch()` performs internally - and re-runs the package's own `install.js` once as a
  repair if the binary is missing, failing loudly and by name if it still is not there afterward.
  It was not the cause of this particular failure (the process had a pid), but it is a distinct,
  previously-seen cause of the identical misleading `exitCode=127`, cheap to check, and now fails with
  a clear message instead of a confusing one thirty log lines later.
- **The `WARN Failed to create bin at .../material-bluemap-render-actions` line earlier in the same
  job log is harmless install-ordering noise, not a real defect.** `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
  links every workspace package's declared `bin` entry before `pnpm build` has produced anything, so
  `packages/render-actions/dist/cli.js` (and `packages/worldgen/dist/cli.js`) do not exist yet at
  link time and pnpm skips those two symlinks with a warning rather than failing. Nothing in this
  repository invokes either bin by name afterward - every call site (`ci.yml`'s `test-world` job
  included) runs `node design/packages/<pkg>/dist/cli.js` by explicit path, and `pnpm build` produces
  that file a few steps later in the same job (confirmed in the log: `packages/render-actions build:
  Done` after `tsc -p tsconfig.json`). No fix was needed.

**Follow-up, 2026-08-06: dependency installation is now one guarded system rather than a
collection of job-local anecdotes.** Every self-hosted job in `ci.yml`, `pages.yml`, and
`build-jars.yml` calls `.github/actions/bootstrap-self-hosted` with one explicit profile.
Linux profiles check commands and shared libraries, batch only the missing distribution packages,
and install pinned `actionlint`, `shellcheck`, and `gh` release archives into `RUNNER_TEMP` after
SHA-256 verification. The Windows package job now uses PowerShell for its staging and collection
steps, so Git Bash is no longer a hidden build dependency; a missing Git installation is repaired
with checksum-pinned MinGit in the job directory. Official setup actions still provide the
manifest-pinned Node/pnpm and upstream-pinned Temurin toolchains.

For this historical D19 implementation,
`design/packages/shared/src/selfHostedCiPolicy.test.ts` was the completeness boundary: a
hand-written ten-job inventory is compared to every literal self-hosted `runs-on` entry, each job
must call its declared profile, and any `pull_request` trigger on those workflow files fails the
test. The Pages deploy job is explicitly inventoried as `action-only`; it has no external command
to install, which is a declared empty dependency set rather than an unexamined omission. See
the superseding D20 decision and `docs/cloud-runners.md` for the current runner inventory. The
self-hosted bootstrap article and code were intentionally removed when D20 restored hosted
runners, so this historical paragraph no longer links to a deleted file.

## D20 — Project workflows returned to standard GitHub-hosted runners

**Decided 2026-08-06, superseding D19 for current runner selection.**

Every executable job in all seven repository workflows now selects an explicit standard hosted
label: `ubuntu-latest` for Linux build, test, render, release and Pages work, and
`windows-latest` for Squirrel.Windows packaging. Reusable-workflow call jobs still declare only
their checked-in `uses` target because GitHub Actions forbids `runs-on` on those jobs. This is a
project-specific exception to any broader fully-self-hosted preference: the current user request
expressly restores hosted runners for this public repository.

The reason is isolation and reproducibility. A public pull request can run repository-controlled
validation on a disposable GitHub-managed environment without executing contributor code on a
maintainer's computer. A failed or cancelled job cannot leave behind processes, package changes,
or workspace state for the next run. Accordingly, `pull_request` is restored to `ci.yml`.

The self-hosted composite action, Linux and Windows bootstrap scripts, and their dedicated
bootstrap article were removed because no job consumes them. The workflows keep ordinary setup
actions and their existing exact sources of truth: pnpm comes from `packageManager` in
`design/package.json`, Node remains 22, Java remains on the Temurin versions required by the
vendored upstream build, and installs continue to use the frozen lockfile. The workflow-lint job
keeps actionlint 1.7.12 and its SHA-256 digest directly in the hosted job; hosted Ubuntu supplies
shellcheck before actionlint runs.

`design/packages/shared/src/cloudRunnerPolicy.test.ts` is the replacement completeness boundary.
Its hand-written list covers all seven workflows and all 36 jobs: 23 command-running jobs with an
exact allowed hosted label, plus 13 reusable calls with an exact checked-in target. It fails when
a workflow or job appears without inventory, when an executable job lacks a standard label, when
a call job grows an illegal label, or when self-hosted/bootstrap wiring returns. See
`docs/cloud-runners.md` for behaviour, configuration, failure modes, security, and verification.

## D21 — Interactive RenderDriver triggers use upstream queue-priority parity

**Decided 2026-08-19 for issue #68.** Interactive `RenderDriver` triggers use the smallest typed
`schedule-next` path needed to match upstream's queue priority. The path inserts the newly
scheduled work after the currently active head, so it never displaces or interrupts the task
already being processed; queued work retains the existing containment, cancellation, and progress
semantics.

This is an explicit parity choice, not an accidental consequence of the existing tail-enqueue
call path. It applies only at the interactive trigger call sites that have the upstream-equivalent
priority requirement; ordinary scheduling remains ordinary scheduling. The corresponding
deviation record names the observable consequence: an interactive refresh can run ahead of queued
region work while the active task remains protected.
