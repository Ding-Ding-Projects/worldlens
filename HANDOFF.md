## Issue #78 — render-engine choice delivery (2026-08-19)

**Current state: source changes are present; source/build evidence for this state is unrun.**
The project now has canonical `upstream-java` and `typescript` ids, a per-project choice, a
global new-project default, and live Java availability in the project editor. Legacy projects
continue to identify the upstream Java engine rather than being silently migrated.

The delivery path stages the TypeScript engine bundle and assets, writes a versioned capability
manifest, and records the staged Java CLI jar's filename, size, and SHA-256 when present. Packaged
runtime resolution consumes that manifest and refuses a missing or mismatched Java artifact; it
does not silently fall back to another engine.

**Pending proof:** no current source/build evidence is claimed here. The next owner must build the
real Windows installer, inspect the packaged output for both engine assets and the manifest, and
render one identical project with each engine. The proof must record the engine id and version for
both renders, demonstrate the no-JVM TypeScript route, and show that an unavailable explicit Java
choice is refused rather than substituted.

## Issue #60 — public 1.0 compatibility contract

This lane prepares the public delivery records for a Windows-only 1.0 compatibility contract. The
intended boundary covers the desktop application and `@worldlens/cli` public surfaces: CLI names
and exit codes, configuration/project/history schemas, HTTP/SSE and add-on APIs, workflow
inputs/outputs, environment variables, file layouts, exports, backup pointers, update metadata,
and accessibility-visible commands. Public surfaces must be labelled stable, experimental,
internal, or deprecated; stable changes use semantic versioning, and migrations, rollback,
support boundaries, and intentional 1.0 deferrals must be stated plainly.

The delivery channel remains the versioned `1.0.<run>` Windows release channel. The package shape
is Squirrel.Windows with unsigned `Setup.exe`, `RELEASES`, a full `.nupkg`, and deltas where
produced. SmartScreen or the operating system may show an unknown-publisher warning; that is an
expected consequence of the permanent no-signing policy.

The committed build path `build.bat /s` completed successfully after the initial bootstrap blocker
was resolved: `vendor/BlueMap` was not checked out, so the declared vendor/BlueMap submodule was
initialized before the build could complete. The build used Electron runtime `v37.10.3`.

No installer package, release, or remote verification was performed. Tests, lint, reviews, audits,
accessibility checks, and screenshots remained unrun in this lane. The compatibility contract,
public-surface inventory, reference/migration examples, and directly related site/roadmap records
are now present; executable drift-proof and newcomer/runtime acceptance remain separate follow-up
evidence and are not claimed.

## Cloud-render restart and UI verification — 2026-08-19

The desktop app now restores persisted terminal cloud-render states, removes terminal rows only
after the complete confirmation flow, and automatically resumes a persisted dispatched run. Resume
is deduplicated in the main process and cannot upload or dispatch again; thrown failures are written
back as terminal records.

End-to-end evidence is GitHub Actions run
[`32229964127`](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/worldlens-bayville-example/actions/runs/32229964127),
started through the real app UI against generated disposable world data. It completed successfully,
published `rendered-map` (1,865,207 bytes), and the app verified SHA-256
`354d391bc59bcb428c99a92201d2aca1fdff28c38e2829a0fc695b1c8bf9cdc6`. The stored row is
`rendered`; the map record is under the configured map-storage directory and opened in the real
viewer through the low-level hidden-desktop plan.

Focused verification: 210 cloud-render/UI tests passed, the later narrowed reruns passed 119, 45,
38 and 5 tests respectively, both app and UI typechecks passed, both app and UI builds passed, the
36-action Adult/Kid plan passed, the 27-action terminal-row removal plan passed, the real dispatch
plan created the workflow run, and the final 44-action collection/viewer plan passed.

Open evidence boundaries:

- `scripts/check-screenshot-evidence.mjs` remains red because the 117 broad application captures,
  15 map-dependent captures, and committed 17-image low-level group predate the current UI digest.
  Fresh low-level raw captures exist but were not promoted because the stronger receipt contract is
  not yet emitted by the producer.
- The complete workspace build initially found a missing local `vite` link in
  `@worldlens/md3-check`. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` restored the declared workspace link
  without lockfile churn, and the subsequent complete build passed all 16 package builds.
