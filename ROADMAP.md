# Roadmap

## Current verified baseline

- Adult Mode and Kid Mode complete their first-run and round-trip journeys through the committed
  low-level hidden-desktop UI plan.
- Cloud-render terminal rows survive restart, expose local-only removal through the two-key/full-
  slider confirmation, and never delete GitHub data.
- Dispatched cloud renders resume from their recorded run id without uploading or dispatching a
  second run. Successful artifacts are downloaded, verified, registered and openable in the map
  viewer.

## Issue #57 — cloud-first project configuration (implementation in progress)

When a world has no project file, the desktop app now offers a guided cloud-render configuration
path instead of requiring one local render first. It generates the complete versioned project
schema from shared defaults, validates the world and render choices, performs no Java or local
render work, saves atomically, records local project history, and returns to the existing CI
preflight with the original request values. Cancellation before the write leaves the world alone;
an existing, unreadable or newer-format project is never silently overwritten.

The implementation is source-level only at this point. The packaged-app interaction and a real
hosted-workflow dispatch remain open evidence before issue #57 can be closed.

## Public 1.0 compatibility contract — issue #60

- **Scope:** Windows-only public compatibility for the desktop application and the standalone
  `@worldlens/cli` delivery surfaces, including CLI names and exit codes, configuration/project/
  history schemas, HTTP/SSE and add-on APIs, workflow inputs/outputs, environment variables, file
  layouts, exports, backup pointers, update metadata, and accessibility-visible commands.
- **Policy:** stable, experimental, internal, and deprecated surfaces are named explicitly;
  stable changes follow semantic versioning; schema migration, rollback, support boundaries, and
  intentional 1.0 deferrals are documented rather than inferred.
- **Delivery facts:** the supported channel is versioned `1.0.<run>` Windows releases packaged
  with Squirrel.Windows. The intended artifacts are unsigned `Setup.exe`, `RELEASES`, a full
  `.nupkg`, and deltas where produced; an unknown-publisher warning is expected.
- **Current state:** `build.bat /s` completed successfully after `vendor/BlueMap` initialization;
  no installer package, release, or remote verification was performed.
- **Remaining evidence:** the public surface inventory, reference/migration examples, and site
  summary are present. Executable drift-proof and newcomer installation/first-render/cloud/offline
  acceptance remain separate follow-up evidence and were intentionally not run in this lane.

## Open verification work

- Refresh the 117 broad application captures and 15 map-dependent captures against the current UI
  source digest. Their inventory remains intentionally red until their real harnesses are rerun;
  changing the recorded digest alone is not acceptable evidence.
- Extend the low-level capture producer with the stronger built-artifact, interaction, privacy and
  transaction receipts required by the promotion workflow before replacing published PNGs with new
  raw captures.
