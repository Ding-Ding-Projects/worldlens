# Migrating from Material BlueMap to Worldlens

Worldlens is the new product and package identity. It remains a from-scratch TypeScript port of
[BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap); BlueMap is the upstream renderer and
viewer project, and this project does not claim that name or erase that credit.

## Behaviour

The first Worldlens launch looks for the legacy Windows profile at
`%APPDATA%\@material-bluemap\app`. When it exists, the app asks once before copying anything.
Acceptance copies through a staging directory, verifies every legacy file by SHA-256, writes a
receipt, activates `%APPDATA%\Worldlens`, and verifies it again. The legacy profile is retained.
Declining is remembered without nagging; retry remains an explicit action.

Before the existing Worldlens root can be renamed, migration writes and flushes
`%APPDATA%\.worldlens-profile-migration-transaction.json`. The journal records the exact source,
staging, current, backup and failed paths; both source and pre-existing-current manifests; and the durable phase. Every
startup recovers that transaction before reading a success receipt: a completed activation is
verified and finalized, while a partial or failed activation restores the retained current root
and quarantines partial staging. A crash cannot turn a Worldlens-only file into an unreachable
backup that the next launch ignores.

The desktop process owns a single-instance lock before migration starts. Migration also rejects a
legacy or current root that is itself a symbolic link, junction, reparse indirection, or resolves
outside the application-data root. Collision keys use Windows case-insensitive semantics even in
cross-platform tests, so `Settings.json` and `settings.json` stop before either root changes. The
exact current manifest is checked again after staging and immediately before its atomic rename;
any concurrent addition, removal, or content change aborts cutover, leaves the changed current root
active, retains the legacy root, and quarantines staging for inspection.

Renderer and documentation-site preferences migrate before stores hydrate. A current Worldlens
value wins when both namespaces exist; otherwise the legacy value is copied to the new key. Old
cells remain for rollback. Legacy appearance files remain importable, while new exports use only
the Worldlens format.

World/project repository adapters read both generations during the compatibility window:

| Surface                 | Current write                                                  | Legacy read                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project file            | `worldlens.project.json`, schema `worldlens.project`, format 2 | `material-bluemap.project.json`, format 1               |
| CI ownership marker     | `.worldlens-ci.json`, tool `worldlens`                         | `.material-bluemap-ci.json`, tool `material-bluemap`    |
| World-repository marker | `.worldlens-world.json`, tool `worldlens`                      | `.material-bluemap-world.json`, tool `material-bluemap` |
| Published-map marker    | `.worldlens-map.json`, tool `worldlens`                        | `.material-bluemap-map.json`, tool `material-bluemap`   |

Unknown project fields survive parse and serialization. New writes use only current identifiers.

Encrypted private-render payloads follow the same rule: new opaque ids and AES-GCM associated
data use `worldlens/private-transport`; the opener recognizes the prior
`material-bluemap/private-transport` generation when its legacy manifest is present. Sealing and
workflow id output never create another legacy payload.

## Configuration

Runtime environment variables use the `WORLDLENS_` prefix. Existing
`MATERIAL_BLUEMAP_` update-feed, GitHub-client, and download-consent variables remain readable;
when both names are set, the Worldlens value wins.

Packaged bridge builds carry both release repositories. The Worldlens feed is tried first and the
former repository is a bounded fallback until this profile has actually downloaded from the
Worldlens feed. The repository-and-channel identity pair is persisted atomically without the
installed version that appears at the end of the feed URL; build 101 therefore retains a
confirmation written by build 100. Changing repository, architecture, or channel invalidates the
confirmation. This prevents later launches from depending on the former repository or on a
repository-rename redirect. See
[Automatic updates](./automatic-updates.md) for the unverified three-version runtime boundary.

The **Product display name** setting is cosmetic. It changes the title bar, About/version line,
notification titles, and introductions. It never changes the data directory, app/package id,
installer name, update feed, schema, markers, diagnostics product name, or repository identity.

## Repository rename finalization

Current live repository, Pages, policy and legal references retain their reachable pre-rename
addresses until the repository rename succeeds. The committed finalizer makes the rename-time
switch deterministic instead of relying on a manual search-and-replace:

```powershell
node scripts/finalize-worldlens-repository.mjs --check-ready
node scripts/finalize-worldlens-repository.mjs --apply
node scripts/finalize-worldlens-repository.mjs --verify-final
```

`--check-ready` verifies the exact old value and occurrence count in every inventoried file
without writing anything. `--apply` preflights the complete inventory before staging same-folder
replacements, installs all 17 targets, and verifies every final Worldlens value. The expanded
inventory includes the desktop crash-report destination, every current Pages repository/base/clone
source, the compact-proof target, and both generated changelog link owners alongside the original
README, contributor, policy, legal and standalone-builder surfaces. Installation
and verification form the rollback transaction: any failure before the explicit committed state
restores every original file byte-for-byte. Backup cleanup starts only after that commit boundary
and is not allowed to enter rollback. If cleanup fails, every finalized target stays in place,
undeleted backups are retained, and the error lists the exact paths to review and remove manually.
Commit the 17-file switch as one changeset, and run it only after the repository rename lands.
`--verify-final` is the post-switch CI guard. Historical changelog entries, release and issue
prose, compatibility readers and archived decisions are deliberately outside this
current-reference switch; only their current link owner changes where the generated changelog must
keep navigation live.

The executable filesystem integration matrix synthesizes the exact pre-cutover form of all 17
inventoried files from the committed replacement contract. It therefore remains executable both
before and after the real repository has been finalized, and proves read-only readiness by hash
and timestamp, normal apply plus verification,
exact rollback during installation, exact rollback after verification, and committed cleanup
failure after one backup has already been removed. Faults enter through an import-only test hook;
the production command has no fault flag or environment-variable switch. A separate residual test
accepts only a wholly ready or wholly finalized inventory and deliberately finalizes one fixture
inside an otherwise ready set to prove that a mixed cutover is rejected.

Worldlens is free software and has no payment, donation, review, or upgrade nags. People who want
to support the renderer this port builds on should support the BlueMap project directly.

## Failure modes

- A divergent file present in both old and new profile roots stops migration and lists only the
  colliding relative paths; neither root is replaced.
- A corrupt consent record or migration receipt is refused instead of guessed.
- An interrupted staging directory is quarantined and rebuilt from retained source data.
- A post-activation verification failure moves the failed target aside and restores the previous
  Worldlens root when one existed.
- A crash before or after backup rename, receipt write, staging activation, verification or
  rollback is recovered from the durable transaction before the app reads the profile.
- A blocked or full browser-storage implementation leaves legacy settings intact for a future
  retry; it never prevents the app or site from starting.

## Security considerations

Migration refuses symbolic links and unsupported filesystem entries so copying cannot leave the
profile root. Credentials remain encrypted or referenced exactly as stored; migration never
prints or returns their values. Receipt and consent writes are staged, flushed, and renamed.

Worldlens Windows artifacts are intentionally unsigned. Packaging fixes `forceCodeSigning`,
`signExecutable`, and `signAndEditExecutable` to `false`, clears inherited signing inputs, and
sets `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`. A resource-only `rcedit` hook preserves the tracked icon
and Windows version metadata without entering electron-builder's signer/editor path. CI recursively
requires `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` to report `NotSigned` for every emitted executable, including
the Squirrel installer; any signer invocation or signed output blocks publication.
HTTPS authenticates the contacted host and protects transport; feed metadata and package hashes
detect bytes that differ from what that host advertised. Because packages are intentionally
unsigned, neither mechanism authenticates the publisher or author. See
[Automatic updates](./automatic-updates.md).

## Verification

Unit coverage exercises old-only, new-only, disjoint merge, divergent and case-only collision,
linked-root escape refusal, concurrent-current-write refusal, denial/retry, corrupt records,
partial staging, rollback, idempotence, legacy/current marker precedence,
schema adaptation, unknown-field preservation, preference migration, and environment aliases.
The migration matrix also injects ordinary failures and simulated process crashes before and
after backup rename, receipt write, staging activation, verification and rollback, then retries
from the retained legacy and current roots.

The packaged Windows app was launched on an off-screen desktop and the real native migration
consent dialog was captured without moving the visible cursor, keyboard focus, or foreground
window. The dialog names the legacy and current profile folders without exposing an absolute
user-profile path.

A copy of the actual legacy profile on the development machine was migrated in an isolated
scratch root: 885 files and 347,197,060 bytes copied, the source digest stayed unchanged, the
target matched every legacy file byte-for-byte, the receipt was present, and the old copy
remained. The scratch copy was deleted afterwards; the real profile was never modified.
