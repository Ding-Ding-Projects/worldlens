/**
 * Build the changelog from this repository's own git history and its release tags.
 *
 * Nothing here is written by hand and nothing here is invented. Every version comes from a
 * tag that CI actually published, every entry comes from a commit that is actually in the
 * history, and every entry carries the full SHA of that commit so a reader can go and look
 * at it. A version with no commits of its own says exactly that rather than borrowing a
 * neighbour's, and generation fails outright rather than emitting a reference to a commit
 * that cannot be resolved - a wrong SHA is worse than no SHA, because it sends the reader
 * somewhere confidently irrelevant.
 *
 * ### Where the versions come from
 *
 * The release workflow tags every successful build with the exact packaged SemVer plus a
 * leading `v` (`v<major>.<minor>.<run>`) and publishes a GitHub Release for that tag. The
 * tags are therefore the release record, and they are
 * lightweight tags on the commit that was built, so the date recorded for a version is that
 * commit's own committer date. The GitHub Release itself is published a few minutes later by
 * the same run; that publication timestamp is not recorded here, because taking it would
 * make generation depend on the network and produce a different file offline.
 *
 * A version's entries are the commits reachable from its tag and from no earlier tag. That
 * is deliberately not `previous..current`: three of this repository's tags sit on a side
 * branch that was merged later, and a range expression against the immediately preceding tag
 * alone would either lose those versions' commits or replay them under a later version.
 *
 * ### Where the categories come from
 *
 * From the paths each commit touched, which is a fact about the commit, using the fixed table
 * in {@link CATEGORY_RULES}. The commits in this repository are prose sentences with no
 * `feat:`/`fix:` convention, so an Added/Changed/Fixed classification would have to be
 * inferred from the wording of a subject line - that is interpretation, and interpretation is
 * how a changelog starts saying things nobody wrote. The area a commit changed is derivable
 * without guessing, so that is what is recorded.
 *
 * ### Merge commits
 *
 * A merge is kept as an entry of its own, marked as a summary, carrying the number of commits
 * it brought to the mainline. Its SHA is the commit that completed the change, which is what
 * the entry links, and the commits it summarises are listed under the same version alongside
 * it. Its files are the diff against its first parent, so it is categorised by what it
 * actually brought in rather than by nothing at all.
 *
 * ### Outputs
 *
 * - `CHANGELOG.md` at the repository root: the scannable record, subject plus commit link,
 *   grouped by category under each version.
 * - `design/packages/ui/src/components/changelog/changelogData.generated.ts`: the same record plus each
 *   commit's full message body, which is what the in-app viewer renders and searches.
 *
 * Both are deterministic: no timestamps, no run ids, nothing that changes between two runs
 * over the same history. That is what makes `--check` meaningful in CI.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/build-changelog.mjs            # write both outputs
 *   node scripts/build-changelog.mjs --check    # fail if either output is out of date
 *   node scripts/build-changelog.mjs --quiet    # write, without the summary on stdout
