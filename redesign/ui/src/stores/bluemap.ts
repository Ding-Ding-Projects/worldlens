/**
 * Single shared handle on the live viewer.
 *
 * Upstream reached the one BlueMapApp instance through `this.$bluemap` on every component.
 * The port keeps that single-instance model but hands it out through this module instead of a
 * global property, because the app is torn down and rebuilt whenever the active server profile
 * changes. `shallowRef` is deliberate: `BlueMapApp` owns three.js objects that must never be
 * wrapped in a deep reactive proxy. Its `appState`, `mapViewer.data` and marker data are
 * already individually reactive (the viewer builds them through `makeReactive`), so reading
 * them through these computeds is reactive all the way down.
 *
 * Components MUST NOT keep their own copy of anything reachable from here. `appState.controls`
 * in particular is read by the control bar, the settings menu, the position input and the zoom
 * buttons at once; a local mirror desynchronises the moment any one of them writes.
