// @vitest-environment node

/**
 * The audit trail: every `localStorage`-backed store this package has is either wired,
 * named in {@link APP_SETTINGS_HISTORY_KEYS} with the file that calls `recordAppSetting`
 * for it, or deliberately excluded, named in {@link EXCLUDED_APP_SETTINGS} with a reason.
 * Both are held to their real source rather than trusted on their word - this file reads
 * each `owner` file off disk and greps for the exact call, the same way
 * `menuSearch/menuCoverage.test.ts` holds its own registry to the source.
 *
 * Kept in its own file, under `// @vitest-environment node`: `appSettingsHistorySync.test.ts`
 * runs under jsdom (it stubs `window.worldlens`), and jsdom's own `URL`/`location`
 * globals do not resolve `import.meta.url` the way plain Node does, which is exactly what
 * `fileURLToPath(new URL("...", import.meta.url))` below needs.
