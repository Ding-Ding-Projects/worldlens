/**
 * The seam between the project surfaces and whatever can actually read a world folder.
 *
 * Written to the same shape as `../history/historyHost.ts` and `../backup/backupBridge.ts`,
 * and for the same reasons. A project file lives at the root of a Minecraft world, so
 * finding one, reading one and writing one all need a file system, and this package runs in
 * three places that have three different amounts of access to one:
 *
 *   - inside the Electron shell, where the preload bridge can walk the world catalogue;
 *   - inside a plain browser tab (`pnpm --filter ui dev`), where it cannot;
 *   - inside vitest, where a fake host makes the whole surface testable with no disk
 *     anywhere near it.
 *
 * A missing host is a stated fact, never a disabled-looking button that silently does
 * nothing. {@link useProjectHost} returns `null` when nothing is wired up, and the surfaces
 * say what is missing rather than showing an empty list that reads as "you have no
 * projects" when the truth is "this build cannot look".
 *
 * ## Why every method is probed one at a time
 *
 * {@link projectHostFromBridge} checks for each function separately and refuses a partial
 * answer for the three a project surface cannot exist without. A released desktop shell can
 * load a newer renderer than the one it was built beside, so a surface that assumed the
 * whole namespace was present would render a Save button that throws when pressed - far
 * worse than a surface that says this build cannot open projects.
 *
 * `deleteProject` is deliberately the exception. A shell that can list, read and write
 * projects is a shell where the whole editor works; refusing the entire feature because it
 * cannot delete one would take away the nine things it can do to punish it for the one it
 * cannot. It is probed on its own and reported as {@link ProjectHost.canDelete}, so the row
 * that would offer deletion says plainly that this build does not, rather than offering a
 * gate whose confirm button throws.
 *
 * ## Nothing here carries a secret
 *
 * A project file travels inside a world folder that people zip up and send to each other,
 * and `projectFileSchema` refuses a storage block carrying `connection-properties` for
 * exactly that reason. Nothing on this bridge moves a credential in either direction.
