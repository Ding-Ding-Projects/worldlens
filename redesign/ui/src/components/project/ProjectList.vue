 * fetched here: this component is the presentation, and the screen above it owns the host.
 *
 * Modelled on `../ProfileManager.vue`, which is the other listbox in this application, and
 * deliberately so - the two lists behave identically because a user who has learned one has
 * learned both. Same roving tabindex, same appearance target per row keyed by something
 * that outlives the process, same gate anchored to the row's own button rather than one
 * shared gate that has to be told which row it is standing in front of.
 *
 * Two things it does that the profile list does not, because this collection grows in a
 * different way. It is **multi-selectable**, so forty worlds tried once each can be tidied
 * up in one pass rather than forty; and it **exports**, because a list of where every
 * project lives is exactly the sort of thing somebody wants outside the app.
