/**
 * The version history of one BlueMap config folder: browse, compare, diff, restore, label,
 * trim and export.
 *
 * ### What this panel is looking at
 *
 * A separate Git repository, kept beside this application's own data, holding a mirror of
 * the config folder. Never a `.git` inside the folder the person chose - the header states
 * where the repository actually is, because a version-control feature that does not say
 * where it put a repository is one people rightly distrust.
 *
 * ### Why a restore is safe to press
 *
 * The main process snapshots what is on disk *before* it writes anything back, then records
 * the restore as a new revision on top. Nothing is rewritten and nothing is dropped, so the
 * state a restore replaced is still in this list afterwards and can be restored in turn.
 * That is the property that makes this panel usable rather than frightening, and it is
 * worth saying on screen, which the footer does. It holds for a whole-folder restore, for a
 * single file, and for a single setting alike.
 *
 * ### Any two revisions, not only a revision and its parent
 *
 * Choosing A on one row and B on another compares them however far apart they are. This is
 * the question people actually arrive with - "what has changed since the config last
 * worked" - and without it they were reading four patches and merging them in their head,
 * or giving up and restoring the whole folder, which loses every good change made since.
 *
 * ### Grouped by day, with the live state marked
 *
 * A history that is doing its job gets long, and forty rows of timestamps is not something
 * anybody scans. The rows are grouped by their local day with a summary per day, and the
 * revision that is on disk right now is marked from the *unfiltered* list, because the
 * newest row of a filtered view is merely the newest thing that matched.
 *
 * ### Only one thing here destroys anything
 *
 * Trimming a history removes revisions for good. It is the single call on the host that
 * takes anything away, and the single control in this panel behind the two-key
 * super-confirmation gate. Everything else, restore included, only ever adds.
 *
 * ### Appearance
 *
 * The whole panel is one `AppearanceTarget`, under `history.panel`, so it carries the same
 * right-click **Edit appearance...**, the same keyboard path, and the same non-modal,
 * anchored editor as everything else in this application.
