/**
 * The readable diff, tested against real HOCON rather than against a stand-in.
 *
 * The whole claim of `historyDiff.ts` is that it reports what a *person* would say changed,
 * and the only way to check that is to hand it the kind of file BlueMap actually writes -
 * comments, blank lines, nested objects, arrays, quoted strings - and assert the sentence
 * that comes out. A test built on a hand-made settings map would pass while the parser it
 * ships with disagreed with it.
 *
 * Three of these matter more than the rest, because they are the ones a naive line-diff
 * gets wrong and a reader would never know:
 *
 *  - a setting that moved in the file but kept its value is **not** a change;
 *  - a comment somebody added is **not** a change to any setting;
 *  - a file that cannot be parsed falls back to the raw patch **and says so**, rather than
 *    rendering an empty list that reads as "nothing happened".
