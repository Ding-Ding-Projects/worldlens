/**
 * The panel's decisions, tested without mounting anything.
 *
 * Two of these are worth more than the rest, because they are the ones that go wrong
 * quietly:
 *
 *  - **The filters compose.** Every combination is asserted, not just each filter alone,
 *    because the failure mode is not "the date filter is broken" - it is "the date filter
 *    works until you also pick an action", which every single-filter test passes.
 *  - **The actions come from the data.** A hard-coded list would pass a test written
 *    against today's actions and silently stop covering tomorrow's. So an invented action
 *    the union in `historyHost.ts` has never heard of is put through and has to come out
 *    the other side as a chip with a count.
