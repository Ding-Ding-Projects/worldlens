/**
 * The seam between the history panel and whatever can actually run git.
 *
 * Written to the same shape as `../config/configHost.ts`, and for the same reasons. The
 * panel has to work in three places with three different amounts of privilege:
 *
 *   - inside the Electron shell, where the preload bridge can reach a real repository;
 *   - inside a plain browser tab (`pnpm --filter ui dev`), where it cannot;
 *   - inside vitest, where a fake host makes the whole panel testable with no git and no
 *     file system anywhere near it.
 *
 * A missing host is a stated fact, never a disabled-looking button that silently does
 * nothing. {@link useHistoryHost} returns `null` when nothing is wired up, and the panel
 * says what is missing.
 *
 * ## Why every method is probed one at a time
 *
 * {@link historyHostFromBridge} checks for each function separately and refuses a partial
 * answer. That looks paranoid until you remember that a released desktop shell can load a
 * newer renderer than the one it was built beside: a panel that assumed the whole
 * namespace was present would render a Restore button that throws when pressed, which is
 * far worse than a panel that says this build keeps no history.
 *
 * ## Nothing here rejects
 *
 * Every method resolves with a value, failures included. That is inherited from the main
 * process on purpose - see `main/history/ipc.ts` - and it is what lets the config editor
 * call {@link HistoryHost.snapshot} after a save without wrapping it in anything: the worst
 * a broken history can do to a save is return `{ ok: false }` into a value nobody has to
 * act on.
