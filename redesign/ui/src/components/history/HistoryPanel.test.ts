// @vitest-environment jsdom

/**
 * The history panel, mounted.
 *
 * Everything asserted here is a property of the rendered component rather than of the model
 * next door, which has its own tests. The four that matter most:
 *
 *  - **Every control does the thing it looks like it does.** A panel of buttons that render
 *    and emit nothing is the exact failure this project keeps finding, so Record now, the
 *    expander, Restore and the label field are each pressed and each has to reach the host.
 *  - **Restore asks twice.** One click arms it, the second performs it. A single click that
 *    rewrites files on disk from a list of forty rows is a slip nobody recovers gracefully
 *    from, even when it is undoable.
 *  - **A missing history is a sentence, not a dead panel.** Both shapes are covered: no
 *    bridge at all, and a bridge whose machine has no git.
 *  - **The diff is fetched on expand and not before.** Otherwise a four-hundred-revision
 *    history runs four hundred `git diff` calls to draw a list nobody scrolled to.
