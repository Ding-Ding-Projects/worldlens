/**
 * Turning two versions of a config file into a list of settings that changed.
 *
 * ## Why a unified patch is the wrong unit here
 *
 * A patch is a diff of *lines*, and these files are not lines, they are settings. The two
 * coincide often enough that a patch looks acceptable and then stops being so exactly when
 * it matters. Some examples this module exists to fix:
 *
 *  - `-sky-color: "#7dabff"` / `+sky-color: "#ffffff"` is two lines the reader has to
 *    compare character by character to learn one fact. `sky-color: #7dabff to #ffffff` is
 *    the fact.
 *  - A key moved from the top of the file to the bottom with the same value is a five-line
 *    patch describing a change that did not happen.
 *  - A comment somebody added above a setting is a patch hunk with no setting change in it
 *    at all, and it sits between the reader and the change they were looking for.
 *  - A value written across several lines shows up in a patch as whichever of those lines
 *    happened to differ, which can be none of the interesting ones.
 *
 * So this reads both sides with the same HOCON model the editor writes files with, flattens
 * each to `dotted.key -> value`, and reports the difference between those two maps. What
 * comes out is what a person would say happened.
 *
 * ## The raw patch never goes away
 *
 * Every readable diff carries its patch, and the interface keeps it behind a disclosure.
 * That is not a hedge, it is the honest answer to two real cases: a file this editor does
 * not model, and a change the flattening genuinely loses (a comment, an ordering, a
 * formatting choice). When either happens, {@link readableFileDiff} says so in
 * `unreadable` and the interface shows the patch instead of pretending there was nothing
 * to see.
 *
 * ## Nothing here throws
 *
 * A config file in a history is by definition a file that once existed on somebody's disk,
 * which means it may be half-written, truncated by a crashed editor, or not a config file
 * at all. Every parse is caught and turned into a sentence. A history panel that threw
 * while rendering a row would take out the one screen the user opened to recover from
 * whatever went wrong.
