 * possible. `throughputModel.ts` has the whole honesty argument for why the reading is
 * percent-per-minute rather than an invented tile or chunk count -- upstream's own progress
 * line never carries one, and this file will not pretend it does.
 *
 * A fresh tracker per mount, watching `facts.levels`' own overall percentage - the same

 * silently never updating on screen no matter how many observations arrive afterwards. This
 * is the dependency that makes {@link reading} recompute: written once here so a future
 * caller only has to remember to bump it, not to rediscover the plain-closure-in-a-computed
