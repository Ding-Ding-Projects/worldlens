/**
 * The one progress surface, and the vocabulary every route speaks to it.
 *
 * Mount {@link RenderProgressDetail} with a `ProgressFacts` and it draws the breakdown:
 * overall, the phase inside it, the unit being worked, real counts where real counts exist,
 * elapsed time, time since anything last arrived, an honest estimate or none at all, byte
 * transfers where a route counts bytes, and every shard job by name and state.
 *
 * There is deliberately one of these rather than one per route. `renderRun.ts` builds the
 * facts for a render on this machine, in a container, or on a machine over SSH — those
 * three arrive on one event stream on purpose. {@link ciProgressFacts} builds them for a
 * render on GitHub's runners from the run report the CI surface already holds.
 *
 * `progressModel.ts` is pure and has no Vue in it, so the rate, the stall detection and the
 * estimate can be tested without mounting anything.
