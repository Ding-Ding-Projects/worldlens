/**
 * What the notification centre shows, decided without a component.
 *
 * A toast is a message that leaves. That is the whole point of it, and it is also the whole
 * problem with it: the one notice worth reading twice is exactly the one that scrolled past
 * while somebody was looking at the map. The queue in `components/config/notifications.ts`
 * has always kept a bounded history for that reason, and until now the only thing reading it
 * was a menu that listed messages in one flat column with no way to find anything. Fifty
 * entries deep, that is an archive rather than a review surface.
 *
 * So the filtering lives here, as functions over plain arrays, for the same reason the queue
 * does: what counts as a match, what a level filter means when nothing is selected, and what
 * text a regular expression is actually tested against are all decisions a test can pin
 * without mounting Vuetify, a menu and a search field to ask.
 *
 * The engine is the settings editor's own `regexEngine`, reached through
 * {@link createSettingMatcher}, so the pattern a user builds in the centre behaves exactly
 * as one built in the options search bar: ECMAScript `RegExp`, evaluated locally, bounded,
 * plain text by default with regex an explicit opt-in.
 *
 * A date range joins the search and the level chips as a third filter, narrowing what the
 * other two left rather than replacing either - the same composition
 * `components/history/historyModel.ts` and `components/changelog/changelogModel.ts` already
 * use, read through the same `ChangelogDateFilter.vue` calendar. `noticeDay` reads the day a
 * notice's own `at` falls on in the reader's local timezone, for the same reason
 * `historyModel.ts`'s `revisionDay` does: a notice raised at eleven at night belongs under
 * that evening's date, not tomorrow's because the reader's offset happens to be positive.
