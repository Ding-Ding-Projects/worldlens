/**
 * Bounded ECMAScript regular-expression evaluation for the settings search bars
 * and their builders.
 *
 * The engine is the host runtime's own `RegExp`, which is also what
 * {@link createSettingMatcher} filters settings with, so the builder's preview
 * cannot disagree with the search that consumes the pattern. Evaluation is local
 * and in memory: no pattern and no sample text is transmitted, logged or
 * persisted anywhere.
 *
 * Each search surface in this app owns its own copy of this adapter (the marker
 * menu has `markers/regexEngine.ts`, the main menu has `menu/regex.ts`) so that
 * one surface's limits cannot be changed out from under another's.
 *
 * ### Dialect and escaping
 *
 * ECMAScript, as implemented by the running JavaScript engine. A literal is made
 * to match itself by backslash-escaping every metacharacter, which is what
 * {@link escapeLiteral} does. `\d`, `\w`, `\s`, `\b`, named groups `(?<name>…)`,
 * back-references and lookaround all behave exactly as they do in the browser.
 *
 * ### Limits
 *
 * Pattern 512 characters, sample 20000 characters, 500 reported matches, 100 ms
 * of wall clock per preview run. They are stated in the builder's own interface
 * as well as here, because a limit the user cannot see is a limit that reads as
 * a bug when it bites.
 *
 * On top of those, a pattern whose shape backtracks exponentially is refused
 * before it is compiled. See `regexRisk.ts` for why the size and time limits
 * cannot cover that case on their own: the wall clock is checked between matches,
 * and an exponential pattern never returns from the first one.
