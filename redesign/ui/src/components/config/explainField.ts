/**
 * The doc-disclosure and default-provenance pair, for the two editors that show a
 * `FieldMeta` without going through `ConfigField.vue`.
 *
 * `ConfigField.vue` has carried this pair since the settings screen shipped: a
 * "show the rest of the explanation" toggle once `field.doc` runs past three
 * lines, and a line underneath the control saying whether the current file wrote
 * this setting or is quietly inheriting BlueMap's own default. That pair applies
 * to every one of the 154 settings a config file's own top-level schema reaches
 * (`configSearch.test.ts` pins that count), because `ConfigFileForm.vue` renders
 * every field of every group through `ConfigField.vue` with no per-field opt-out.
 *
 * A render mask's shape fields (`min-x`, `radius`, `size`, …) and a marker set's
 * own container properties (`label`, `sorting`, `toggleable`, `default-hidden`)
 * are settings in the same honest sense — BlueMap reads them, each carries a real
 * default, and a file can either name one explicitly or fall back — but they
 * reach the user through `ConfigMaskField.vue` and `ConfigMarkerSetsField.vue`
 * instead, one row of an array or one property of a record rather than a whole
 * file's own `EditableConfigFile`. `isExplicit`/`isDefaultValue` in
 * `configModel.ts`/`fieldValue.ts` answer that question for a *file*; this module
 * answers the same question for a *record* — the mask shape's own object, or one
 * marker set's own object — which is the shape both of those editors actually
 * hold.
 *
 * Kept framework-free on purpose, so "does the toggle open at the right length"
 * and "does explicit-vs-inherited come out right" are ordinary function tests
 * rather than requiring a mounted component for every case.
