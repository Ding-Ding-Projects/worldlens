/**
 * Issue #6's contract, kept true by a test rather than by remembering.
 *
 * The rule is short: **every search bar in this application offers the regex builder**,
 * anchored beside the field it belongs to. It is not a rule about most search bars, and
 * it is not satisfied by a builder living somewhere else on the surface.
 *
 * It is also the rule most likely to decay, because nothing about writing a plain
 * `v-text-field` labelled "Search" feels like a violation while you are doing it. A
 * surface ships, the field looks right, and the contract quietly covers one fewer place
 * than it did last week. That is exactly what happened before this test existed: three
 * builders were wired to ten surfaces and four collections had grown their own unsearched
 * lists, while the issue still read "not implemented".
 *
 * So this walks every component in the package and asks two questions:
 *
 *  1. Does this file contain a **search-shaped input** - one whose label, placeholder,
 *     name, model or class says search, filter, find or query?
 *  2. If so, does it get its search from one of the three shared fields, each of which
 *     carries an anchored builder?
 *
 * A file that answers yes and no is a failure. A file that legitimately holds a
 * search-shaped input that is *not* a search - a value editor whose field happens to be
 * called `filter`, say - has to be named in {@link NOT_A_SEARCH_BAR} with the reason, so
 * the exemption is a sentence somebody wrote rather than an absence nobody noticed.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT do is check that the builder works. That is what the
 * per-surface mount tests are for, and duplicating them here would make this file slow
 * and fragile without making it stricter.
