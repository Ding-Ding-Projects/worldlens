/**
 * A render mask, shared or reused as its own small file — export and import.
 *
 * `render-mask` already lives inside a map's own `.conf`, but that ties one drawn shape to
 * one map. Somebody who drew a nice outline around their village wants to reuse it on a
 * different map, or send it to somebody else's copy of this app, without hand-copying HOCON.
 * This is that file: a self-describing JSON document holding exactly the mask list
 * `combinedMaskSchema` already validates, plus the units and coordinate convention stated
 * in the file itself so it is still readable years later by someone who has never seen this
 * app's source.
 *
 * The format is deliberately thin — it is a wrapper around the same `MaskConfig[]` the config
 * schema owns, not a second schema to keep in sync with the first. {@link exportMaskFile}
 * and {@link importMaskFile} round-trip through `combinedMaskSchema.parse`, so a file this
 * module writes is guaranteed to be a file this module (or a hand-edited one shaped like it)
 * can read back, and an import that fails says exactly what about the file did not validate
 * rather than silently producing an empty mask.
