/**
 * The novice "Speed" dial: one 1-5 number standing in for two raw `core.conf`
 * settings at once, `render-thread-count` and `render-thread-priority`.
 *
 * Both are documented in `@worldlens/config`'s `core.ts`:
 *
 *   render-thread-count     "A higher value can improve the render speed, but
 *                            could impact performance on the host machine."
 *                            No schema-enforced bound. Zero or negative means
 *                            "available cores minus this value" -- the doc's own
 *                            example is a 6-core machine and -2, giving 4
 *                            threads. Java default: 1.
 *
 *   render-thread-priority  "How the thread-priority affects actual performance
 *                            depends on your JVM." Bounded 1-10 by the schema.
 *                            Java default: 5. Hidden behind Advanced today,
 *                            because a bare JVM priority slider means nothing to
 *                            somebody who has never heard of one.
 *
 * Neither BlueMap nor its Java class ever calibrated a "speed" scale across the
 * two of them -- that mapping is this application's own invention, laid out
 * below rather than hidden in a formula, and the copy that describes it says so
 * rather than implying it is a number upstream chose.
 *
 * Level 3 is pinned to BOTH raw defaults exactly (`threadCount: 1`,
 * `threadPriority: 5`), so a freshly generated `core.conf` -- or any `core.conf`
 * that never mentions either key -- reads as "Balanced" rather than "Custom".
 * `speedLevels.test.ts` checks that against the schema's own defaults directly,
 * so the two cannot drift apart silently.
 *
 * This module is framework-free on purpose: `SpeedControl.vue` is the only
 * thing that renders it, but the level table, the round-trip match and the
 * "does this raw pair count as Custom" question are all plain logic that a
 * component test would otherwise have to exercise through a mounted DOM.

/**
 * The five levels, gentlest to fastest.
 *
 * `threadCount` follows the doc's own "cores minus this value" convention for
 * the two gentle levels, so a low speed leaves more of the host machine free
 * regardless of how many cores it actually has, rather than picking an absolute
 * thread count that means something different on a 4-core laptop and a 32-core
 * server. `threadPriority` climbs across the schema's full 1-10 range.
 *
 * Every value here is distinct across every level, in both columns, which is
 * what makes {@link speedLevelFor} a reliable round trip: no two levels can
 * ever be confused for one another, and `speedLevels.test.ts` checks that this
 * stays true rather than assuming it from the literals below.

 * `RenderRequest.renderThreads` -- `render-thread-priority` is never set by that path at all
 * (it stays behind the Advanced config editor's own `core.conf`, a different file for a
 * different render), so there is no pair to match here, only a count. `null` covers two
 * different reasons, same as {@link speedLevelFor}'s own `null`: the request never named a
 * count at all (`kind: "automatic"`, this machine's own default applies), or it named one
 * that matches none of the five levels (`kind: "custom"`). Both are real, distinct states a
 * live-render surface has to say plainly rather than fold into one "unknown".
