/**
 * The seam between the options GUI and whatever can actually touch a disk.
 *
 * Everything else in this folder is pure: it reads and writes strings, and never
 * knows where a config folder lives. That is deliberate. The editor has to work
 * in three places with three different amounts of privilege:
 *
 *   - inside the Electron shell, where a preload bridge can read a folder, write
 *     files, open a native picker and probe a database;
 *   - inside a plain browser tab (`pnpm --filter ui dev`), where none of that
 *     exists;
 *   - inside vitest, where a fake host makes the whole flow testable without a
 *     file system.
 *
 * A missing host is a stated fact, never a disabled-looking button that silently
 * does nothing. {@link useConfigHost} returns `null` when nothing is wired up,
 * and the surfaces that need one say what is missing and keep every read-only
 * capability (editing, validating, previewing and copying the file text) working.
