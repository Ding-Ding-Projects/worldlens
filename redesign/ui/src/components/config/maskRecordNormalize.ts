/**
 * Filling in a `render-mask` row's own defaults, so `maskGeometry.ts` can be handed a real
 * `MaskConfig` rather than whatever subset of fields a hand-typed or partially-drawn row
 * happens to hold.
 *
 * `ConfigMaskField.vue` stores each shape as exactly what the file says -- a row that never
 * mentions `radius` really does omit it, and `fieldValueOf` supplies `MASK_SHAPES`' own
 * default the moment the UI needs a number to show. This module does the same thing for a
 * whole render-mask list at once, recursively (a blur's nested `masks` needs it too), so a
 * cost estimate over the list sees the same numbers the editor already shows rather than
 * `undefined` turning into `NaN` the moment arithmetic touches it.
 *
 * An entry whose `type` names a shape `MASK_SHAPES` does not recognise is dropped rather
 * than guessed at -- `ConfigMaskField.vue` already shows that row its own "unknown shape"
 * notice, and a cost estimate has nothing honest to say about a shape it cannot identify.
