/**
 * The guard for "need these on every single element": every setting the options
 * editor shows gets the full explanation with its disclosure toggle, and the
 * default-provenance line, truthfully.
 *
 * `ConfigField.vue` has always carried that pair for the 154 settings
 * `configSearch.test.ts`'s `buildSettingIndex()` counts. This file adds the two
 * places that count does not reach, because neither is a `FieldMeta` a whole
 * config file owns: a render mask's own shape fields (`MASK_SHAPES`, rendered by
 * `ConfigMaskField.vue`) and a marker set's own container properties
 * (`MARKER_SET_FIELDS`, rendered by `ConfigMarkerSetsField.vue`). Together the
 * three sources are every place this editor puts a `FieldMeta` in front of
 * somebody.
 *
 * ## Why an explicit list, not just a property check
 *
 * A test that only asks "does every enumerated field have a non-empty doc and a
 * real default" would have passed the day before this task started, for the
 * wrong reason: `ConfigMarkerSetsField.vue` rendered its four container
 * properties as hand-written controls with no `FieldMeta` behind them at all, so
 * nothing about them was ever enumerable in the first place. A property check
 * over an enumeration can only fail on a field *inside* the enumeration; it says
 * nothing about a setting that never joined it, which is exactly how the marker
 * set gap survived unnoticed. `EXPECTED_MASK_FIELDS` and
 * `EXPECTED_MARKER_SET_FIELDS` below are hand-maintained manifests of what
 * `MASK_SHAPES` and `MARKER_SET_FIELDS` are supposed to contain, so a shape or a
 * property added to the schema without a matching update here is a red test
 * naming exactly what is missing, rather than a silently wider enumeration that
 * still reports everything covered.
