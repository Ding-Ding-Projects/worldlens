/**
 * Non-blocking notifications for the settings editor, plus the history that
 * keeps a dismissed one reviewable.
 *
 * Informational, success and progress messages never block. Errors and warnings
 * stay until they are dismissed, because a failure that auto-dismisses is a
 * failure nobody read. Anything that needs a decision before work can continue
 * is a dialog instead, and none of those live here.
 *
 * The state is a plain object rather than a component, so the queue's own rules
 * (auto-dismiss timing, stacking order, the bounded history) can be tested
 * without mounting anything.
 *
 * The history is the data behind the notification centre in
 * `components/notifications/`, which filters and searches it. The rules stay
 * here; the panel only reads them.
 *
 * ## How long a toast stays is itself a setting
 *
 * `state.durationLevel` is the novice dial `noticeDurationLevels.ts` defines - level 3 by
 * default, matching `INFO_TIMEOUT_MS` / `SUCCESS_TIMEOUT_MS` below exactly, so a profile
 * that has never touched the setting behaves exactly as this queue always has.
 * `NotificationDurationRow.vue` is the control; this module only reads the level `notify`
 * is called against, the same "the state carries the setting, the row only changes it"
 * split `mode`/`megabytes` follow in `renderMemorySetting.ts`.
