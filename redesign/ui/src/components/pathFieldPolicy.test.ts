/**
 * The browse affordance's own contract, kept true by a test rather than by remembering.
 *
 * The rule is short: **every field that names a folder or a file on this machine offers the
 * native browse button**, `PathField.vue`, alongside the box a path can still be typed or
 * pasted into. It is not a rule about most path fields, and it is not satisfied by a picker
 * living somewhere else on the screen.
 *
 * `HANDOFF.md`'s own trap is the reason this file has two halves rather than one. A rule
 * test that only re-checks the fields a wiring pass already touched catches a `PathField`
 * quietly turned back into a `v-text-field` - but it has nothing to say about a ninth path
 * field written next month that never got a browse button in the first place, because
 * nothing about writing a plain `v-text-field` labelled "Folder" feels like a violation while
 * you are doing it. Two different failures, so two different halves:
 *
 *  1. **The named list** (`WIRED_PATH_FIELDS`). Every field the wiring pass reported, taken
 *     from the actual report and checked against the actual source rather than trusted. This
 *     catches the affordance being lost from a field that had it.
 *  2. **The structural sweep**. Every `v-text-field`/`v-textarea`/`VTextField`/`VTextarea` in
 *     the whole package whose label or hint reads as a filesystem location, cross-checked
 *     against `PATH_FIELD_EXEMPTIONS`. A path-shaped field with no `<PathField>` block in its
 *     file and no exemption fails outright. This catches a path field that was never wired at
 *     all - which is exactly how `components/project/ProjectEditor.vue`'s "Where the rendered
 *     map is written" turned up while this file was being written: a real absolute path, on a
 *     plain text box, with no browse button and no test that had ever asked. It now carries
 *     `PathField` and is in the named list instead of the exemption table.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT do is check that `PathField.vue` itself works - that is
 * `PathField.test.ts` and `pathFieldHost.test.ts`, and duplicating them here would make this
 * file slow and fragile without making it stricter.

 * Why a path-shaped field is not a gap, as one of a closed set of three reasons - closed for

 * writing prose in `note` would make an exemption exactly as easy to fake as no exemption at
 * all, and `it('proves every "own-browse" exemption really has one...')` below only knows how
 * to check three.
 *
 *  - `not-a-location`  Names an identifier, a slug, or the file's own text content - not a
 *                       place on disk to navigate to. `config.maps.fileName` is the config
 *                       file's own name being chosen, not an existing path being found.
 *  - `own-browse`      A folder/file browse already lives in this file, predating
 *                       `PathField.vue` (`WorldFolderStep.vue` and `MapStorageStep.vue` are
 *                       the two `PathField.vue`'s own file header names as exactly that
 *                       precedent). Checked, not just claimed: the file must still call
 *                       `pickFolder(`/`pickFile(` itself.
 *  - `remote-machine`  The path names a location on a different computer.
 *                       `RemoteTargetEditor.vue`'s own identity-file field sits right beside
 *                       this one and does use `PathField`, which is the proof the split is
 *                       deliberate rather than an oversight: a local file dialog can open a
 *                       path this machine can see, and the ssh work directory is never that.
