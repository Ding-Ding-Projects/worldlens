 *
 * `reason` is shown whenever `disabled` is true, as the row's subtitle - a screen reader
 * hears it as part of the same option, and a sighted person sees it without hovering for a
 * tooltip that a filterable list has nowhere obvious to anchor. A disabled row with no
 * `reason` set renders with no subtitle at all rather than a blank one, which is a real gap
 * this doc comment used to promise was already covered and was not: every caller wiring a
 * `disabled` row is expected to also set `reason`.

/**
 * A small fixed-item command menu's own filter field, for every menu in this application
 * that used to be a bare `v-list` with no way to search it.
 *
 * `TabMenuList.vue` already gives the tab and group context menus a keyboard-reachable
 * local filter with a no-match state and Escape support; this is the same shape for
 * everything that was not built on that component -- the history comparison's "Export"
 * picker, the EULA viewer's "Export" picker, and the changelog viewer's "Copy" and "Export"
 * pickers. Filtering only ever hides rows: `shown` narrows what is rendered, never what an
 * item's `id` or `disabled` state is, so a chosen row still does exactly what it always did.
 *
 * ### Escape, in two steps
 *
 * With something typed, Escape clears the query and stops there -- `preventDefault` and
 * `stopPropagation` keep it from reaching the surrounding `v-menu`, so the full list comes
 * back rather than the whole menu vanishing out from under someone who only meant to see
 * the rest of it again. With nothing left to clear, Escape is left alone: it bubbles to the
 * `v-menu` hosting this list, which already closes itself on Escape by default, exactly the
 * behaviour every other filterable menu in this application relies on.
 *
 * ### What is announced
 *
 * The list carries the caller's own accessible name (`label`), the empty state is
 * `role="status"` so a screen reader hears it the moment filtering leaves nothing, and the
 * search field is the project's own `ConfigSearchField`, so the anchored regex builder
 * arrives with it -- the same contract every search bar in this application keeps.
