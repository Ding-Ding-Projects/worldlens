/**
 * The worlds already on this machine, offered as a list.
 *
 * Somebody creating a map almost always wants a world they already have, and until now
 * the only way to name one was to know where Minecraft keeps its saves and type the path
 * without a mistake. This asks the shell instead: the default Minecraft folder for this
 * platform, plus every folder the person has mounted, each scanned for worlds and each
 * world listed with the facts people actually choose by, most recently played first.
 *
 * ## It is an addition, not a replacement
 *
 * Nothing here is required to make a map. The step around this keeps its path field, its
 * folder picker and its drop target, and a world on a USB stick or pulled off a server is
 * named directly with nothing mounted and nothing configured. A world that happens to sit
 * inside a mounted folder is resolved to the row it already has rather than listed twice.
 *
 * ## Why a listbox
 *
 * Because that is what it is: one thing chosen from many. A stack of cards would need a
 * tab press per world to walk ninety saves, and would announce no position, no count and
 * no selected state. The rows carry their details in their accessible names for the same
 * reason they carry them on screen: "New World (2)" four times over is not a choice
 * anybody can make, and the details are the entire difference between the four.
 *
 * Focus and selection are deliberately separate here. In a plain listbox selection
 * follows focus, but choosing a world runs a folder inspection, and moving the arrow key
 * down ninety rows would start ninety of them. Arrows move focus; Enter, Space or a click
 * chooses, and `aria-selected` marks the world the wizard is actually pointed at.
 *
 * ## Mounted folders
 *
 * People keep several Minecraft installations on one machine. The detected default is
 * entry one and is there without anybody adding it; the rest are mounted by hand, take
 * either an installation or the `saves` folder inside it, and are labelled so that two
 * folders both called `saves` can be told apart. Unmounting takes a row out of this list
 * and touches nothing on disk, which is said in as many words beside the control, because
 * "unmount" next to a list of somebody's worlds reads as "delete" to a reasonable person.
