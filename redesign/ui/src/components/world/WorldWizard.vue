/**
 * The create-a-map wizard: five steps between "no map" and a render running.
 *
 * This is **the quick way in, not the only one**, and it says so on screen. It asks for the
 * least a render needs and offers sensible answers to the rest; the project editor holds
 * every setting BlueMap has, for a world that wants them. The two are not two features:
 * finishing here writes a project file, so five answers produce something that can be
 * reopened and edited in full rather than one render and then nothing.
 *
 * That is also why a world that already has a project is offered it. Re-running a guide
 * over a world somebody has already set up would either duplicate the map or quietly
 * overwrite the settings they chose, and both are worse than a sentence saying the project
 * is there.
 *
 * The rules live in `wizardModel.ts` as plain functions over refs, so what this component
 * does is arrange them: it never decides whether a world is valid, what a map id may
 * contain, or which settings reach a render.
 *
 * The step header is navigation, not decoration. A step nobody can answer yet is disabled
 * and says so; every answered step can be gone back to; and the whole strip is
 * keyboard-reachable with the current step announced.
