/**
 * Renders that stopped without finishing, and the offer to carry them on.
 *
 * A render of a large world runs for hours. The app closing, the machine
 * sleeping, the power going out or somebody pressing Cancel must not cost the
 * work already done, and it does not: BlueMap's storage is incremental, so
 * resuming re-runs the same render against the tiles already on disk and skips
 * everything it has already drawn. Nothing is deleted and nothing is restarted
 * behind anybody's back.
 *
 * A refused resume is shown as the refusal it is, with the reason. `config-changed`
 * is the one that actually happens: the settings moved since the render died, and
 * carrying on would leave half the map drawn with the old ones and half with the
 * new. That is a real answer, not an error, and it says which choice is left.
 *
 * Renders that are going right now are read at the same time and kept in their own
 * list, never merged into the offers. A running render has not stopped, so it is
 * not something to carry on, and a single list that mixed the two would put a
 * "carry on" button on a render already in flight - a button whose only possible
 * answer is `already-running`.
