/**
 * The worlds already on this machine, and the words that describe one.
 *
 * Step one of the wizard used to be a path field, which asks somebody to know where
 * Minecraft keeps its saves and to type it without a mistake. It now also offers the
 * worlds it can find: the default Minecraft folder for this platform, plus every folder
 * the person has mounted, each world listed with the facts people actually pick by.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. The bridge supplies the rows, this decides how they sort, what
 * their secondary line says, what a search matches against, and where an arrow key moves
 * the selection - so each of those can be tested without a file system and without a DOM,
 * and so the component below is arrangement rather than logic.
 *
 * Two rules run through all of it:
 *
 *  - **Nothing is guessed.** A field the main process could not read is null, and a null
 *    field is left out of the line rather than filled in with something plausible. A
 *    world whose `level.dat` is unreadable still appears, with what is known and a note
 *    saying the rest could not be read, because a world that silently vanishes from a
 *    list somebody knows it belongs in is the worst answer available.
 *  - **The list is an addition, never a replacement.** The typed path, the folder picker
 *    and the drop target all still name a world directly, with nothing mounted and
 *    nothing configured. A world on a USB stick is a normal world.
