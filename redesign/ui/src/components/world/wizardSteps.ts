/**
 * The wizard's steps, and where each of BlueMap's map settings is asked.
 *
 * Nothing here lists a setting by hand except the five the first, second and
 * fourth steps ask for in their own words. Everything else is whatever remains in
 * `@worldlens/config`, grouped by the schema's own groups, so a setting
 * added to the schema tomorrow appears in the options step with no change to this
 * file. That is the whole point: a hand-written list of 92 fields is a list that
 * silently stops being 92 fields, and nobody notices until somebody asks why a
 * setting cannot be reached.
 *
 * Which groups start folded is derived too. A group is advanced when every
 * setting left in it is one upstream marks advanced, so a first render never
 * requires reading tile geometry documentation, and an expert still finds it two
 * clicks away rather than in a text editor.
