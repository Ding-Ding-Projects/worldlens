/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * The guide's screen, mounted, for the two things only a mounted one can answer.
 *
 * ## The consent regression
 *
 * Consent used to be read once in `onMounted` and never again. The user-visible failure was
 * a remedy that led nowhere: the review step warned that the Mojang download had not been
 * accepted and offered **Open the setting**; the setting opened, accepting it worked and
 * persisted; and the warning stayed for the life of the window, including after navigating
 * to another step and back. The person did exactly what they were told and the application
 * went on telling them they had not.
 *
 * The test that would have caught it is the one below, and the shape of it is the point: a
 * test that only checks the warning appears when consent is false passes throughout the
 * entire life of this bug. What has to be asserted is that accepting it **while the screen
 * stays mounted** clears the warning.
 *
 * ## The other thing
 *
 * Finishing the guide writes a project file, which is what stops it being a dead end. That
 * is also invisible to a test of the wizard component on its own, because the wizard emits
 * answers and this screen is what turns them into a file.
