/**
 * The rules behind the world list: what sorts first, what a row says, what a search looks

 *
 * All of it is pure, so all of it is tested here without a DOM and without a file system,
 * and the component next door is left with arrangement rather than logic. The cases that
 * matter most are the ones about *not* guessing: a world with no recorded date must not
 * be presented as an old one, and a world whose `level.dat` could not be read must keep
 * every fact that was never in doubt.
