/**
 * The notification centre's bulk-action bar: select-all in both of its honest scopes, invert,
 * clear, and every bulk action a single notice already offers - dismiss, delete, export as
 * JSON or Markdown, and mark-as-read.
 *
 * Lives at `components/NoticeBulkToolbar.vue`, outside `components/notifications/`, for the
 * reason `notificationsBulk.ts`'s file header explains: `components/notifications` is a
 * finished surface in `catalogueCoverage.test.ts`, and keeping the two components that call
 * this toolbar's own keys out of that folder let the bulk toolbar exist before its copy was
 * registered, without wiring a half-written catalogue entry into an already-finished surface.
 * The registration has since landed in `copy/surfaces/index.ts`. `NoticeCentrePanel.vue`
 * mounts this as a child and adds no `t()` call of its own for anything it renders.
 *
 * Selection itself is owned by the parent, not here: `selected` arrives as a prop and every
 * change to it - select all in either scope, invert, clear, or the selection an action
 * consumes once it runs - leaves through `update:selected` rather than being held as local
 * state. The parent is also where each row's own checkbox lives, and a selection split
 * across two independent copies is a selection that can only ever agree by accident.
 *
 * Every action that actually changes something previews its honest impact right on its own
 * button and status line before it runs, per `noticeBulk.ts`'s `BulkImpact`/`ReadImpact`:
 * how many are selected against how many will really change, so "5 selected" and "3 will
 * dismiss" are never conflated into one number that quietly means whichever is convenient.
 * Delete is the one destructive action here, and it never runs from a plain click at all -
 * it sits behind the same two-key, full-range-slider gate every other delete in this
 * application does, with the exact count and the notices themselves as the reviewable
 * preview `ConfigSuperConfirm` shows before the slider can even move.

 * changed, so the `v-if` guarding the clicked button (or the whole `hasSelection` block it
 * lives in) closes right under the pointer. Left alone, the browser drops focus to `<body>`
 * the instant that happens, stranding a keyboard or screen-reader user with no way back into
 * the toolbar without starting over from the top of the document.
 *
 * The status paragraph below is the one element in this toolbar that is never conditionally
 * rendered - it is also the live region that just announced what happened - so it is where
 * focus lands instead. `tabindex="-1"` on it makes that a legal, if unusual, focus target
 * without adding it to the normal tab order.
