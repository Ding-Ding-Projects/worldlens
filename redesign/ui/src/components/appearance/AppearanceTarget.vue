/**
 * Wraps any element and gives it the whole appearance feature.
 *
 * This is the per-element integration the contract describes, expressed once as a wrapper
 * rather than repeated per surface. A host writes `<AppearanceTarget id="app.tab" ...>` around
 * whatever it renders and gets: the resolved appearance applied live, a context menu with
 * **Edit appearance...**, a keyboard path to the same command, Shift+right-click straight to
 * the editor, a non-modal editor anchored beside the element that tracks it and flips at the
 * viewport edge, and focus back on the element when it closes.
 *
 * ## Why a wrapper and not a mixin on every component
 *
 * Because the alternative is twenty near-identical implementations and nineteen chances to
 * forget the focus return. The failures the contract names - a right-click path with no
 * keyboard equivalent, an editor that traps focus, an anchor lost when tabs reorder - are all
 * failures of consistency rather than of ambition, and they are prevented by there being one
 * copy of this code.
 *
 * ## The keyboard path is not a courtesy
 *
 * `Shift+F10` and the Menu key are what a Windows user presses to open a context menu, so
 * they open this one. `Ctrl+Shift+F10` goes straight to the editor, mirroring Shift+right-click
 * exactly, and the menu item displays that shortcut beside its label - the same shortcut, from
 * the same handler, so the two cannot drift apart. The wrapper advertises both through
 * `aria-keyshortcuts`, which is how assistive technology learns about a binding it cannot see.
 *
 * ## The host keeps its own menu
 *
 * The `menu` slot is rendered above the appearance commands, so a tab that already has a
 * management menu keeps it and gains **Edit appearance...** underneath, which is what the
 * contract asks for rather than a menu that replaces whatever was there.

 * `aria-haspopup`/`aria-expanded`/`aria-controls`/`aria-owns` onto whatever `:activator` points

 * exactly how "right click menu not closing when clicking off the menu" was reported: the
 * click that was supposed to dismiss the menu landed inside `root` and the directive waved it
 * through.
 *
 * `:target` positions an overlay without any of that side effect, so both menus below use
 * `:target` only and the wrapper wires all four accessibility attributes onto `root` by hand
 * instead of trusting `:activator` to do it as a side effect. `aria-owns` matters here as much
 * as `aria-controls` does: both popups render through a `<Teleport>`, so their content is not a
