/**
 * The live appearance state, and how a component binds itself to a piece of it.
 *
 * One module-level state rather than a provide/inject tree, for the same reason the
 * notification centre and the palette keep theirs: an element deep in a dialog inside a menu
 * has to see the same appearance as the tab that opened it, and threading a provider through
 * every intermediate component means the one place somebody forgets is the one place the
 * theme stops applying. It is a plain `ref` over a plain immutable value, so every write goes
 * through the pure functions in `appearanceStore` and can be reasoned about there.
 *
 * ## Registration is a fact, not a claim
 *
 * A component that can be restyled calls {@link registerAppearanceTarget} when it mounts and
 * drops out again when it unmounts, so the editor's element list is a list of elements that
 * exist right now. The alternative - a hard-coded inventory of every tab, menu and toolbar
 * the app is supposed to have - is a list of claims, and the first entry to go stale is
 * indistinguishable from a bug in the editor. The editor's own chrome is the exception and is
 * listed statically, because it exists for exactly as long as the editor does.
 *
 * ## Capabilities are probed once, and absence means yes
 *
 * `CSS.supports` does not exist under jsdom and need not exist in every embedder. The
 * capability probe treats a missing `CSS` as "assume everything works" rather than as
 * "nothing works", because a false negative here would hide a control the platform can
 * perfectly well render, and hiding controls is precisely what the contract forbids.
