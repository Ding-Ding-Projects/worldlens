/**
 * Where appearance lives between launches, and how it travels between machines.
 *
 * Three jobs, all of them about not losing what somebody typed.
 *
 * **Persistence.** The same defensive shape the rest of this package uses for stored
 * preferences: storage that throws is a preference that does not survive a restart, which is
 * annoying and nowhere near a notification, so both the read and the write are guarded and
 * silent. A stored blob that is not the shape this build expects is repaired rather than
 * trusted, because the file is editable by hand and by an older version of this app.
 *
 * **Unknown keys survive the round trip.** A theme exported by a later build carries sections
 * this one has never heard of. Dropping them is the obvious implementation and it means a
 * user who opens their theme in an older version, changes one font, and saves silently
 * deletes everything the newer version added. Anything unrecognised is parked in the record's
 * `preserved` bag and written straight back out on export. This build cannot render those
 * values and never claims to; it just declines to be the reason they vanish.
 *
 * **A value with the wrong type is reported, not deleted.** A `fontSize` of `"large"` cannot
 * be used — the editor's stepper has nowhere to put it — but it is still something a person
 * wrote. It goes into `preserved` alongside the unknown keys and is named in the import
 * report, so the user is told which of their settings did not survive and can fix it, rather
 * than discovering later that a value is gone.
