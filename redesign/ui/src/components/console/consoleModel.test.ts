/**
 * The console's arithmetic.
 *
 * Everything asserted here is a decision that goes wrong invisibly. A ring that drops a
 * line and does not count it looks exactly like a complete log. A sticky-scroll rule
 * that is one pixel out looks like a console that has stopped updating. A filter that
 * reads an empty selection as "nothing" looks like the render's output has been lost.
 * None of them throws, none of them fails a type check, and none of them is noticed
 * until somebody is already reading the wrong thing.
