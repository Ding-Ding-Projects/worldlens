/**
 * The two things about the palette that outlive one opening: how big it is, and the key
 * that opens it.
 *
 * **Size is a user choice and it is remembered.** A search box that swallows the whole
 * window is overwhelming on a large display and frightening when it was opened by mistake,
 * so the default is the bounded card and the full-window view is something somebody asks
 * for. Having asked once, they should not have to ask again on the next launch, which is
 * the only reason this module writes to storage at all.
 *
 * Storage failure is not an error worth showing anybody. A private-mode browser and a full
 * quota both throw on write, and the consequence is that a preference does not survive a
 * restart - annoying, and nowhere near a notification. The read is guarded the same way, and
 * a stored value that is not one of the two known sizes is discarded rather than trusted,
 * because the file on disk is editable by hand and by an older version of this app.

 * what every application with a palette uses and muscle memory is worth more than
 * consistency. That reasoning was wrong twice over. Ctrl+K is already spoken for in a text
 * field on several platforms, and - the part that actually decided it - the documentation
 * site next door binds Ctrl+Shift+F, so the product shipped two different shortcuts for the
 * same feature and whichever one a person learned was wrong half the time. One shortcut, and
 * this is it.
 *
 * Alt is excluded rather than ignored, so that a future Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F belongs to whoever
 * wants it instead of silently opening this. Shift is now required rather than rejected, which
 * is the whole change.
 *
 * `event.key` rather than `event.code`, so the key labelled F on the user's own layout is the
 * one that works. `code` would hard-code the position of F on a US keyboard, which on a Dvorak
 * or AZERTY layout is a different key entirely. Shift makes `event.key` arrive as `"F"` on
 * most layouts and `"f"` on some, so both cases are accepted; comparing case-insensitively is
 * not optional here the way it was for an unshifted letter.

 * reading.
 *
 * The listener sits on `window` in the capture phase. A palette is meant to be reachable
 * from anywhere in the application, including from inside a text field on a settings form,
 * and a bubbling listener can be beaten by anything that stops propagation on its way up.
 * `preventDefault` is called only when the shortcut actually matched, so every other
