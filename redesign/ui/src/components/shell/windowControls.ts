/**
 * The window buttons, without the window.

 * told `frame: false` so the operating system's grey caption bar never appears as product
 * chrome. That buys a title bar which can be Material Design all the way to the corner,
 * and it costs the three buttons the operating system used to draw. This module is the
 * half of them that does not need a DOM.
 *
 * Everything here works against an injected bridge so it can be tested without Electron,
 * and returns `available: false` in a browser tab, where there is no window to minimise
 * and closing the page is the tab's job rather than the application's.
