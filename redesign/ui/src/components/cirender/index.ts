/**
 * Having GitHub's runners render a world this computer cannot.
 *
 * Mount {@link CiRenderScreen}. It resolves the Electron bridge itself, decides for itself
 * whether this build can start a CI render at all, adopts anything already in flight, and
 * shows each sync with the run's real per-job states.
 *
 * The shell is expected to do four things:
 *
 * - `rendered` is emitted when a map has been downloaded and registered. Select it in the
 *   map list; it is mounted exactly like a local render and needs no special case.
 * - `signIn` is emitted when a failure is one that signing in again would fix. Open the
 *   GitHub row in settings; pass `can-open-settings` so a button appears rather than a
 *   sentence naming where to go.
 * - `openConsent` is emitted when Mojang's licence has not been accepted. Open **that**
 *   row - the screen deliberately has no tick box of its own for a legal acceptance.
 * - `open` is emitted with a URL to show in the system browser.
 *
 * `worlds` is optional: pass what this machine already knows about and they are offered
 * beside the folder field rather than instead of it.
