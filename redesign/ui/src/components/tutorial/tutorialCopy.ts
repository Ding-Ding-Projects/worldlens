/**
 * The tour's words, resolved from a step id.
 *
 * `renderRun.ts`'s `phaseLabel`/`adviseOnFailure` are the model this follows: a plain
 * function taking the real `t`, with one literal, quoted-string `t()` call per case rather
 * than a call built from two variables. `appCopy.test.ts` and `catalogueCoverage.test.ts`
 * both find a key's real call site by reading source text for a quoted string argument, so a
 * call whose key and fallback both come out of a variable would be invisible to that scan -
 * and a catalogue entry with no call site the scanner can find is exactly the "translates
 * nothing" failure those tests exist to catch.
 *
 * `tutorialSteps.ts` stays plain data on purpose; this is the one place its step ids turn
 * into words, so the catalogue keys are declared exactly once each.
