/**
 * The tour's own itinerary: pure data, no copy in it.
 *
 * This is deliberately not where the words live. `tutorialCopy.ts` next door is what calls
 * the translator, because a catalogue key needs a literal, quoted-string call site somewhere
 * in the package for `appCopy.test.ts` and `catalogueCoverage.test.ts` to find it, and a step
 * built from two variables - a key and a fallback both read out of this object - would never
 * produce one, since the scanner reads source text rather than runtime values. `renderRun.ts`'s
 * `phaseLabel`/`adviseOnFailure` already draw this line the same way: a plain switch with one
 * literal call per case, fed by an id that lives here.
 *
 * ## What an anchor is, and the promise it makes
 *
 * `anchor` is a CSS selector for the one real control this step is about. It is never
 * invented: every selector below targets an attribute added to an existing, already-shipped
 * element (`data-tutorial-anchor` on a shell tab button or on a rail destination button, or a
 * class the owning component already had). `tutorialAnchors.test.ts` mounts the real owning
 * surface for each step and asserts the selector resolves to a real node, so a control renamed
 * or removed under this tour fails a test instead of quietly pointing the highlight at nothing.
 * A step whose anchor cannot be found is worse than no step at all - see the tour's own
 * requirements - which is why every anchor chosen here is unconditionally present once its page
 * is showing, rather than nested inside a wizard sub-step or a bridge-gated disclosure that
 * might not have rendered yet.
 *
 * `pageId` is the shell's own page id (`App.vue`'s `PAGE_*` constants, as strings): the value
 * `TutorialOverlay.vue` hands to the shell's `revealPage` so the step's real page is on
 * screen before the anchor is measured.
 *
 * Two of those page ids no longer name a tab. The shell rewrite moved Home and Map out of the
 * strip and onto the application rail, so `revealPage("map")` now selects a rail destination
 * rather than opening a tab, and the two map steps point at that rail button - `rail-map` -
 * instead of the `tab-map` that used to exist. Every other step's page is still a job in the
 * strip, and `revealPage` still opens it there.
 *
 * `signal` names an optional {@link TutorialSignal}: when the app fires it while this step is
 * the active one, the tour advances on its own, in addition to the ever-present Next button.
 * Most steps have none, because "click Next to move on without doing it" has to work for
 * every step regardless - a live signal is a bonus for the one step where the action is a
 * single unambiguous click ("choose a world"), not a requirement the rest are missing.
