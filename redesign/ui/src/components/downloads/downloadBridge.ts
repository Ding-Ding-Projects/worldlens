/**
 * The seam between the release-downloads surface and the main process.
 *
 * Every type here is a structural mirror of the one the Electron preload exposes on
 * `window.worldlens`, restated rather than imported for the same reason
 * `worldBridge.ts` restates its own: this package compiles and runs in three places and
 * only one of them has a preload. Importing across that boundary would also drag the
 * archive joiner, the zip reader and `node:fs` into the renderer's bundle, which is
 * exactly what the preload was split out to prevent.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a capability. {@link resolveDownloadBridge} returns `null` when the
 * three methods a download cannot happen without are missing, and the rest are probed one
 * at a time and reported as flags, so a build whose preload has grown half of this shows
 * the half that works and says plainly what the other half needs. A missing
 * `cancelDownload` in particular is survivable and must not be hidden: a download that
 * cannot be stopped is worth knowing about before one is started, not after.
