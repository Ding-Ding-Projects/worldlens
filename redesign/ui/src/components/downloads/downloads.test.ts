/**
 * One download, driven through everything that can happen to it.
 *
 * The events are scripted rather than fetched, which is the only way to exercise a
 * twenty-gigabyte transfer in a millisecond, and they are the exact shapes
 * `main/download/downloader.ts` emits: four phases, byte counts that are stated as exact,
 * a percentage that is stated as an estimate, and three different endings.
 *
 * The reconciliation cases are the ones that would otherwise be found in production.
 * A download outlives the window that started it, and only its record on disk knows which
 * repository it came from, so a surface that read only the events would show a download it
 * could never carry on, and a surface that let the record win would replace live progress
 * with a stale snapshot.
