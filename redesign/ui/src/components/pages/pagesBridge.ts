/**
 * The seam between the Pages-hosting surface and the main process.
 *
 * Every type here is a structural mirror of the one the Electron preload exposes on
 * `window.worldlens`, **restated rather than imported**, for the same reason
 * `ciRenderBridge.ts` and `backupBridge.ts` restate theirs: this package compiles and runs in
 * three places and only one of them has a preload. Importing across that boundary would also
 * drag `node:fs`, a git driver and a process spawner into the renderer's bundle, which is
 * exactly what the preload was split out to prevent.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a capability. {@link resolvePagesBridge} returns `null` when the four
 * methods a publish cannot happen without are missing, and the rest are probed one at a time
 * and reported as flags, so a surface can say "this build cannot take a site down" rather than
 * drawing a button that does nothing.
 *
 * ## No credential crosses this, in either direction
 *
 * There is no token on any of these types and no channel that could carry one. Authentication
 * is `gh`'s own credential store, held in the main process's child processes and never read.
 * When `gh` is signed out the surface learns it from a report that names the command to run in
 * a terminal, because `gh auth login` cannot be driven from inside an application at all.
