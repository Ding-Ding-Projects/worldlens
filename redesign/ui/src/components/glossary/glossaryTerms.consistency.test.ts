/**
 * Every `GlossaryTermMeta.anchor` has to be a real heading in the bundled `glossary` article,
 * or "Read more in the glossary" lands on the top of the page instead of the term - the same
 * silent-drift failure `docsContent.test.ts` guards the bundle itself against. This reads
 * `docs/glossary.md` off disk directly, independent of the `import.meta.glob` bundling path,
 * and slugs its headings with the exact algorithm `renderMarkdown` uses
 * (`@worldlens/viewer`'s `slugifyHeading`, in `packages/viewer/src/util/markdown.ts`),
 * so a term whose anchor no longer matches a real heading - a typo in either file, a renamed
 * section - fails here rather than shipping a dead link nobody notices until they click it.
 *
 * `slugifyHeading` is duplicated below rather than imported, and deliberately not run under
 * a browser-like DOM environment: importing `@worldlens/viewer` pulls in its whole
 * three.js/hammer.js viewer surface, which needs a real browser regardless. `markdown.test.ts`
 * in `packages/viewer` is what proves the real function; this copy is checked against it by
 * the "matches a known slug from a real heading in this repository's own docs" case below, so
 * a change to the real algorithm that this copy misses fails loudly here too.
