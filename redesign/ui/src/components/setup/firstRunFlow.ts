/**
 * The first-run flow itself: three steps, one consent answer, one completion.
 *
 * Kept out of the components on purpose. Everything that decides anything lives here as
 * plain functions over refs, so the rules that matter can be proved by a unit test
 * rather than by somebody clicking through a wizard and hoping:
 *
 *  - consent is answered on the consent step or not at all. There is no `next()` that
 *    walks past it;
 *  - **completion happens whichever way consent was answered.** Declining is an answer,
 *    it is remembered, and the person who gave it is not shown this dialog again on the
 *    next launch, and the launch after that, until they give in. That failure mode is
 *    the entire reason `completeFirstRun()` is separate from `acceptDownload()` in the
 *    main process, and `finish()` calls it on both paths;
 *  - going back after accepting and then declining actually withdraws the acceptance,
 *    rather than leaving a record that says yes while the screen said no;
 *  - a bridge failure never silently swallows the answer. The flag stays unset, the
 *    dialog says so, and setup opens again next launch, which is the safe direction.
 *
 * `start()` asks the main process whether this is a first launch. In a plain browser
 * there is no bridge, there is no local rendering to consent to, and nothing is shown.
