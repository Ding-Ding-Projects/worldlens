/**
 * The first-run flow, mounted, and the two claims only a rendered component can settle.
 *
 * **Accepting is never pre-selected.** Everything about this application's consent
 * handling rests on the answer being a real choice, and every convenient way of building
 * a consent step quietly stops it being one: a checkbox that starts ticked, an Accept
 * button that is the dialog's default so Enter presses it, an Accept styled prominently
 * beside a Decline styled as a link. None of those are visible in the flow controller's
 * state, which is why they are asserted here against the DOM.
 *
 * **The licence is a step before the question.** It has its own progress number and its
 * own Next, and it carries no control that answers anything. A licence shown after the
 * buttons is a licence nobody opens.
