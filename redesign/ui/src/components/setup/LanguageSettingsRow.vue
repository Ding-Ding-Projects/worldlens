/**
 * The language mode and both funny levels, on the settings surface.
 *
 * The same `SetupLanguagePanel` the first-run flow shows, mounted rather than reproduced.
 * Two copies of a control that writes the same three persisted keys is how a slider in one
 * surface stops agreeing with the slider in the other, and the failure is silent: both
 * screens look right, and only the one that was opened second is telling the truth.
 *
 * Before this existed the three settings were reachable **only** during first-run setup.
 * They persisted, they worked, and once setup was completed there was no way back to them
 * short of clearing the profile, which is not a setting being configurable, it is a setting
 * being asked once. The contract wants them reachable from the settings surface, and this
 * is that.
 *
 * The words this section can be searched by live in `languageSearch.ts`, not on this
 * component, exactly as consent's do in `consentSearch.ts`. A settings surface folds them
 * into the search it already owns rather than this row growing a second search bar to
 * compete with it, and a module function is readable before this component has mounted,
 * which a template ref is not.
