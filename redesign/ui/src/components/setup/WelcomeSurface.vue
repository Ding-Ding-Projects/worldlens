/**
 * "What is this?", as a panel the user places, standalone from first-run setup.
 *
 * The first-run flow answers this question once, inside a modal that never reappears
 * once setup is complete - by design, per `firstRunFlow.ts`'s own doc comment. That is
 * correct for the question "do you want to see this now", and wrong for "can I ever see
 * this again": the scouting pass this exists to fix explicitly asked for a surface that
 * "must stay reachable afterwards (Help/About or the docs browser)". This is that route,
 * modelled directly on `EulaSurface.vue` two directories over - the same
 * `DockedSurface.vue` wrapper, the same "mount one in the shell and open it from
 * anywhere" shape, opened from Home's introduction card and the command palette's own
 * row in `App.vue` rather than only existing inside
 * the bundle. `WelcomeIntro.vue` is the shared body, so the words here are exactly the
 * words the welcome step showed, not a second, potentially drifting explanation.
 *
 * The one thing this panel has that the first-run step does not: a live "Start here"
 * button. The welcome step can only ever *say* where the wizard is, because it sits
 * inside a blocking modal opened before anybody has had a reason to navigate; this panel
 * is mounted beside the real tab strip, so its button can actually switch to it.
