 * The language mode and both funny levels, offered during first-run setup so the rest of
 * the flow can be read in whichever voice somebody wants.
 *
 * Two sliders, not one. The English level and the Cantonese level are independent
 * settings: English can stay buttoned up while Cantonese lets loose, and neither slider
 * moves when the other does. Both persist immediately, so the choice survives closing
 * the app halfway through setup.
 *
 * The funny level restyles the copy around the consent question. It never touches the
 * consent facts themselves, which resolve from the EXACT catalogue with the level not
 * consulted at all (see `setupI18n.ts`).
 *
 * The disclosure under the sliders is not decoration and is not optional. The level styles
 * every message the application produces, errors and warnings included, and somebody is
 * entitled to know that before they move a slider rather than after an error reads oddly.
 * It is rendered at the current level like everything else, and every level of it still
 * says that errors and warnings are included and that the facts do not move.
 *
 * The accessible name of a Vuetify slider comes from its `name` prop, which is what the
 * thumb (the element carrying `role="slider"`) renders as `aria-label`; an `aria-label`
 * passed to `<v-slider>` lands on the wrapper instead and names nothing. `aria-valuetext`
 * is not forwarded either, so the level's name is announced through a polite live region
 * beneath the track rather than being left visible but unspoken.
