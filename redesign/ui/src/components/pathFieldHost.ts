/**
 * The bridge behind `PathField.vue`: the screen-agnostic folder/file picker.
 *
 * `configHost.ts` probes `window.worldlens.config` and is only ever installed by three
 * screens (`WorldScreen.vue`, `ProjectsScreen.vue`, `ConfigScreen.vue`) through
 * `provideConfigHost()`. Settings, Backup and the remote target editor sit outside all three,
 * so `useConfigHost()` resolves to `null` there even in the real desktop app. This probes
 * `window.worldlens.dialog` directly instead - reachable from anywhere in the renderer,
 * with nothing to provide and nothing to inject.
 *
 * Same all-or-nothing rule as `createBridgeConfigHost`: a half-wired bridge is worse than
 * none, because it would show a working-looking browse button that throws the moment
 * somebody clicks it.
