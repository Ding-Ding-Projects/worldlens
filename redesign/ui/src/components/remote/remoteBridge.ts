/**
 * The seam between "where does this render run" and the main process.
 *
 * Every type here is a structural mirror of one the Electron preload exposes on
 * `window.worldlens`, restated rather than imported for the same reason
 * `backupBridge.ts` restates its own: this package compiles and runs in three places and
 * only one of them has a preload. Importing across that boundary would drag `node:child_process`,
 * an SSH client and a known_hosts writer into the renderer's bundle, which is exactly what
 * the preload was split out to prevent.
 *
 * ## Nothing here invents a capability
 *
 * There are **two** bridges, resolved separately, because they answer two different
 * questions and a build can have one and not the other:
 *
 * - {@link resolveRemoteBridge} — can a render be handed to a machine over SSH?
 * - {@link resolveRuntimeBridge} — can this app say what Docker is doing on *this* machine,
 *   and can it hand a render to a local container?
 *
 * Each method is probed one at a time and reported as a flag, exactly as the backup bridge
 * does. A surface built on this shows what really works and says plainly what the rest
 * needs; it never presents a control that throws on press.
 *
 * ## There is no password anywhere on this bridge
 *
 * Not as a field, not as an argument, not as a return value. A remote target is a host, a
 * port, a user name and the **path** to a key file that this application never opens.
 * {@link RemoteTarget} is therefore safe to persist by construction, and
 * `sanitiseTarget` in `remoteTargets.ts` drops anything that arrives claiming to be a
 * secret, whatever wrote it.
