/**
 * `RemoteTargetEditor.vue`'s identity-file field, since the shared browse affordance
 * (`PathField.vue`) just replaced its plain `v-text-field`.
 *
 * Three things are worth a test here rather than trusting `PathField.test.ts` alone:
 *
 * 1. The field's own accessible name actually reads "Browse for the SSH identity file" once
 *    it is mounted inside this form, not just in `PathField.vue`'s isolated harness - a
 *    typo'd `field` prop would pass every other test in the package.
 * 2. A pick writes into `draft.identityFile` through the same `patch()` path typing does,
 *    so Save still sees it.
 * 3. The security explanation that used to be the text field's Vuetify `hint` is still on
 *    screen, because `PathField.vue` has no `hint` prop and that paragraph is the one place
 *    this feature says out loud that there is no password anywhere in it.
 *
 * The work directory used to be left alone on purpose: it names a path on the *remote*
 * machine, which a local Electron file dialog cannot see, so it kept its plain text field
 * and grew no browse button. That reasoning held only while there was no other way to look
 * at a remote folder. Now that `main/remote/browse.ts` can list one over the same `ssh` this
 * whole feature already trusts, the work directory is exactly "a remote path currently
 * typed" and gets its own browse button too - backed by that SSH listing, never by the local
 * file dialog `PathField.vue` uses. The tests below prove that distinction rather than
 * merely that a button exists: the work-directory button must never touch
 * `window.worldlens.dialog`, and must depend on the *remote* bridge's `canBrowse`
 * rather than on the local dialog bridge `PathField.vue` probes.
