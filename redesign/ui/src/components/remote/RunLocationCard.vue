/**
 * Where this render runs — asked where somebody starts a render, not buried in settings.
 *
 * There are four answers now and this is the one screen that shows all four together:
 *
 * ```
 * on this computer        the engine as an ordinary program. Fastest.
 * in a container here     isolation and a different Java. NOT more processors.
 * on another machine      over SSH, in a container there. Costs an upload of the world.
 * on GitHub's runners     their machines do the work; this one only uploads.
 * ```
 *
 * The first three are a choice this render obeys. The fourth is a whole workflow of its own
 * - a repository, two consents, an upload, a job list - so it is presented here with the
 * others and opened as its own surface rather than crammed into a radio button. Somebody
 * comparing them should see four answers in one place; what they should not get is four
 * different screens to discover independently.
 *
 * ## Nothing here overstates what a build can do
 *
 * Both bridges are probed method by method, exactly as `backupBridge.ts` does. A place this
 * build has no channel for reads **unsupported** and says which channel is missing, rather
 * than being quietly selectable and silently rendering somewhere else. That last failure is
 * the one worth spelling out: a Docker choice that fell back to local without saying so
 * would leave somebody believing they had chosen, which is worse than not offering it.

     * applying once the box is a flex container, `overflow: hidden` still clips, and the
     * inherited `nowrap` leaves the heading no line to break on. The heading is a
     * translated sentence - "Where this render runs" in English - and this card is one of
     * the surfaces the wizard renders in a narrow column, so a longer locale was cut off
     * mid-character with no ellipsis. Same fix as `DockerWorldSourcePanel.vue`'s
