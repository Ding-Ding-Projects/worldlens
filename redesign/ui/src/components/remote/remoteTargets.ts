/**
 * The machines somebody has told this application about, and the form for adding one.
 *
 * ## There is no password field, and there is nowhere to put one
 *
 * That is the design of the whole remote path, restated on this side of the bridge because
 * this is where a field would get added. A {@link RemoteTargetDraft} holds a host, a port,
 * a user name, and the **path** to a key file that this application never opens. That is
 * everything. Authentication is an SSH agent, or a key that stays exactly where it is.
 *
 * A password that exists somewhere is a password that ends up in a settings file, a log
 * line, a crash report or a screenshot, so the way not to leak one is not to have one.
 * {@link sanitiseStoredTarget} enforces that on the way *in* as well: a record written by an
 * older build, imported from somewhere, or edited by hand is stripped of anything calling
 * itself a password, a passphrase, a secret or a key blob before it is ever shown or sent.
 *
 * ## Why these are persisted at all
 *
 * Because retyping `user@build-server.lan:22` and a key path every time somebody wants to
 * render is how a feature stops being used. Persisting them is safe by construction: there
 * is nothing secret in one. The list lives in the renderer's own storage, is never sent
 * anywhere, and every field is re-validated by the main process before it reaches an `ssh`
 * argument - a stored target is a convenience, never a trusted input.
