/**
 * The three places a render can be sent, and what the interface is allowed to claim.
 *
 * Two properties matter more than the rest and both are about not misleading somebody:
 *
 * 1. **Docker is never sold as speed.** Its description has to name the cost in the same
 *    breath as the benefit, because somebody choosing a container to render faster has
 *    chosen it for the one thing it cannot do.
 * 2. **A place that cannot take a render is never selectable.** A choice that silently
 *    falls back to the local engine leaves the person believing they chose, which is worse
 *    than the choice not being offered.
