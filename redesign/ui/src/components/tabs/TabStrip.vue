/**
 * The tab strip: a pinned region, groups, ordinary tabs, and an overflow surface
 * that is never a clipped edge.
 *
 * The strip renders and reports; it changes nothing. Every action emits to the
 * host, which owns the one {@link TabStripState} and hands a new one back down.
 * That is why there is no local copy of the order here to drift out of step with
 * what was persisted.
 *
 * ### Nothing is ever silently clipped
 *
 * When the ordinary region cannot hold every segment, the ones that do not fit
 * are moved into an overflow menu and the button says how many. The arithmetic
 * is `fitCount` in `tabModel.ts`, which pays for the overflow button out of the
 * same budget - otherwise the button lands on top of the tab that only just
 * fitted, and a tab hidden under a button is exactly the failure the contract
 * names. Widths are measured once per segment and cached, because a hidden
 * element measures zero and a recompute from zeroes would flap between states.
 *
 * The pinned region is measured out of the budget first and never overflows, so
 * a pinned tab stays reachable however many ordinary tabs are open. Pinned tabs
 * render compact when the strip is tight and keep their full accessible name
 * through `aria-label`, so what a screen reader announces does not shrink with
 * the button.
 *
 * ### Roles and roving focus
 *
 * One `role="tablist"`, one `role="tab"` per tab, and `aria-controls` on the
 * selected tab only - the other panels are not rendered, and pointing at an
 * element that does not exist is worse than pointing at nothing. Exactly one tab
 * carries `tabindex="0"`, so Tab reaches the strip once and the arrow keys move
 * within it. A group header is a button inside the tablist: it is deliberately
 * not a tab, it is skipped by the arrow keys, and it announces its own name,
 * count and expanded state.
 *
 * Tabs inside a collapsed group are not in the focus order, because focus that
 * lands on something not drawn looks like the key did nothing. They are still in
 * the strip, still searchable, and still closed by a close-to-the-right.
 *
 * ### Appearance
 *
 * Every tab and every group is a target of the shared appearance editor, under
 * the ids `tab.<id>` and `group.<id>` in the same global, id-keyed store every
 * other target in the app uses (the title bar, the tab bar itself, a project
 * row) - not the opaque `appearance` field `tabModel.ts` reserves on the record
 * itself. That field stays exactly as it was: unread, round-tripped verbatim,
 * and free for whatever eventually wants a slot that travels with the tab's own
 * persistence rather than with the appearance feature's. Using the shared store
 * instead means a tab gets the whole editor - typography, presets, export,
 * reset - for free, rather than a second, smaller implementation of it.
 *
 * The context menu gains **Edit tab appearance...** / **Edit group appearance...**
 * underneath the existing commands, Shift+right-click on a tab or a group header
 * opens the editor directly, and Ctrl+Shift+F10 does the same from the keyboard -
 * mirroring `AppearanceTarget`'s own convention exactly, so the gesture means the
 * same thing everywhere in this application. The editor is anchored to the tab
 * or group element, not to the pointer, and closing it returns focus there.
 *
 * The whole strip is itself wrapped in its own `AppearanceTarget` (`app.tabBar`, in
 * `App.vue`) for right-clicks on strip chrome that is neither a tab nor a group -
 * empty space, the pinned-region divider. That wrapper listens for the identical
 * `contextmenu` and `ContextMenu`/`Shift+F10`/`Ctrl+Shift+F10` gestures on its own
 * root element, so every one of `onTabContextMenu`, `onTabKeydown`,
 * `onGroupContextMenu` and `onGroupKeydown` above calls `event.stopPropagation()`
 * the moment it decides a tab or group owns the gesture. Without that stop, the
 * native event keeps bubbling past this component after being handled here and
 * fires the wrapper's handler too, opening a second, independent menu or editor
 * stacked at the same anchor point - two `v-menu` overlays neither one closes for
 * the other. The stop is what keeps "right-click a tab" and "right-click the bare
 * strip" from ever answering to the same handler.

                                Opening a group makes its tabs exist, which is the moment
                                `styles/motion.scss`'s `.mb-motion-enter` animation runs -
                                a CSS animation fires when its element is created and never
                                again, so this is an entry and not something that replays
                                every time a label or a dirty dot changes.

                                Nothing here can disturb the overflow measurement:
                                `measure()` reads each segment's `offsetWidth`, and the
                                animation moves only `opacity` and `transform`, neither of
                                which a layout box has ever heard of. Collapsing stays
                                instant - the tabs are removed with the `v-if`, and there is
                                no exit to sit through before the strip is short again.
