/**
 * Browser-style tabbed navigation: a persistent strip, an overflow surface that
 * never clips, pinning, groups, four separate searches and two bulk closes.
 *
 * Mount {@link TabbedNavigation}, declare the pages, and render one named slot
 * per page id. It owns the whole layout, restores it on launch and writes it
 * back on every change; nothing else needs to know that tabs exist.
 *
 * ```vue
 * <TabbedNavigation :pages="pages">
 *     <template #map="{ tab }">…</template>
 *     <template #world>…</template>
 * </TabbedNavigation>
 * ```
 *
 * Everything else is exported for tests and for a shell that wants to compose
 * the pieces itself. The four searches are worth naming individually, because
 * "four searches" is the part of the contract most easily reduced to one search
 * with a scope argument:
 *
 *  - {@link searchStripTabs} - the current strip, overflow and collapsed groups
 *    included;
 *  - {@link searchGroupTabs} - one group, scoped by its own membership;
 *  - {@link searchGroups} - group names across every strip;
 *  - {@link searchAllTabs} - every tab in every strip in every window.
 *
 * Each is rendered by its own `ConfigSearchField` with its own anchored builder
 * and its own query, mode and flags. `TabFinder` carries three of them and
 * `TabGroupMenu` carries the per-group one, because that is the only place where
 * "this group" needs no picker to be unambiguous.
 *
 * Per-tab and per-group appearance is deliberately not here. The model carries
 * an opaque {@link AppearanceRecord} on both, storage round-trips it verbatim,
 * and {@link setTabAppearance} and {@link setGroupAppearance} are the attach
 * points; nothing in this folder reads inside those records.
