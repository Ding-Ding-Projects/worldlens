/**
 * What a tab strip is made of, and every operation that changes one.
 *
 * This module is pure data and pure functions. Nothing here touches the DOM, the
 * clock, storage or Vue, which is deliberate: the awkward parts of browser-style
 * tabs are ordering rules, not rendering. "Where does a tab go when it is
 * unpinned", "what happens to a group's members when the group is removed",
 * "which tab becomes active when the active one closes" are all questions with
 * exactly one right answer that a mounted component test would prove slowly and
 * a unit test proves in a line. The components in this folder render what these
 * functions decide and add nothing of their own.
 *
 * ### One authority per ordering
 *
 * The contract asks for four separate orders to survive a restart: tab order,
 * pinned order, group order and membership. The temptation is to store one array
 * of tabs and derive the rest by filtering it, which reads well until a tab is
 * pinned - at which point its position means two things at once and every later
 * operation has to guess which one the user meant. So each order gets exactly one
 * field that owns it, and nothing else is allowed to imply it:
 *
 *  - {@link TabStripState.tabs} is the set of tabs, keyed by id. Its array order
 *    carries no meaning at all beyond being a stable iteration order.
 *  - {@link TabStripState.pinnedOrder} is the pinned region, left to right.
 *  - {@link TabStripState.slots} is the ordinary region, left to right, where a
 *    slot is either one ungrouped tab or one whole group. That single list
 *    carries both the ordinary tab order and the group order, so the two cannot
 *    contradict each other the way two parallel arrays eventually would.
 *  - {@link TabGroup.tabIds} is the order inside that group.
 *
 * Every id therefore appears in exactly one place, and {@link normalizeStrip}
 * enforces that on anything read back from disk.
 *
 * ### Pinning takes a tab out of its group
 *
 * A pinned tab lives in the pinned region; a grouped tab lives inside its group's
 * run. Those are two different places on screen and a tab cannot be in both, so
 * pinning clears membership (this is also what Chrome does). The alternative -
 * keeping the membership and merely hiding the tab from the group's run - makes
 * the per-group search report a tab that is demonstrably not in the group, which
 * is worse than losing the membership because it is a lie rather than a loss.
 *
 * ### The slot reserved for appearance
 *
 * Per-tab and per-group appearance is a separate piece of work. What it needs
 * from here is somewhere to attach and a promise that this module will not throw
 * it away, so {@link TabRecord.appearance} and {@link TabGroup.appearance} are
 * opaque records: this module never reads inside them, every operation carries
 * them through untouched, and storage round-trips them verbatim. See
 * {@link setTabAppearance} and {@link setGroupAppearance}.
 */
