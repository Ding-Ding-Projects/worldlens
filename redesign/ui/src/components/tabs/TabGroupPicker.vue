/**
 * The picker behind the tab context menu's single "Move this tab into group..." entry.
 *
 * Replaces what used to be one menu item per existing group. This is the anchored,
 * non-modal surface `TabStrip.vue` opens from that one entry: a search field wired to the
 * project's own regex builder (via `ConfigSearchField`, the same field `TabMenuList` and
 * `TabGroupMenu` already use for their own search bars), a list of every other group by
 * name, colour and member count, and a "New group..." row that always appears so the
 * picker is never a dead end -- not on a strip with no groups yet, and not when a search
 * has filtered every existing group out of view.
 *
 * Selecting an existing group or "New group..." is the only thing this component decides;
 * doing it is the host's job. `assign` carries the chosen group's id straight to
 * `assignTabToGroup`, the same store action the group menu's own "Take this tab out of its
 * group" and the master search's per-result actions already call, and `new-group` is the
 * same event `TabStrip.vue` already emits for its existing "Put this tab in a new group"
 * command -- both reused rather than forked, so there is exactly one way a tab ever changes
 * group in this application.
 *
 * ### Keyboard and focus
 *
 * Opening the picker focuses the search field, exposed as `focus()` for the host to call
 * right after it renders the dialog open. ArrowDown/ArrowUp move a tracked `activeIndex`
 * across the flat entry list (rendered rows first, "New group..." last) and move real DOM
 * focus onto that entry, using a standard roving-tabindex listbox: only the active option
 * carries `tabindex="0"`, every other option carries `-1`, and `aria-selected` names which
 * one that is for a screen reader. Enter commits whichever entry has focus, and Escape
 * cancels from anywhere in the dialog. Tab and Shift+Tab wrap between this dialog's first
 * and last focusable elements rather than escaping onto the tab strip behind the picker
 * while it is open -- and that trap also covers the search field's own regex-builder
 * popover (`ConfigRegexBuilder.vue`, reached from the ".*" button `ConfigSearchField.vue`
 * renders): Vuetify's `v-menu` teleports that popover's content straight to `document.body`,
 * outside this dialog's own DOM subtree, so it is folded into the trap by a document-level
 * listener rather than the local `@keydown` binding, which a teleported subtree's events
 * never bubble into. See `openBuilderElements` and `trapAcrossBuilder` below. The host is
 * responsible for returning focus to the tab that opened the picker once it closes, exactly
 * as it already does for the tab's own appearance editor.

 * Tab from that button skip straight to Cancel (`focusableElements()`'s own last element),

 * it in there instead means stepping forward from the button enters the popover, stepping
 * forward off the popover's own last control reaches Cancel next, and Shift+Tab off the
 * popover's own first control returns to the button that opened it, matching what a sighted
 * mouse user already sees happen visually.
 *
 * Also stops the event from bubbling any further once handled. `onKeydown` below and

 * starts inside `rootRef` reaches `onKeydown` first via ordinary bubbling and, if this

 * before this listener existed.
 *
 * Also a no-op whenever focus is no longer inside the popover by the time this runs, which is
 * not the same condition as "the popover is open": Vuetify's own `v-menu` binds its own
 * bubble-phase `keydown` listener directly to the popover's content, closer to the pressed key
 * than this `document`-level one, and it already implements exactly the boundary this trap
 * exists for -- Shift+Tab on the popover's own first control (with `retain-focus` off, the
 * default) closes the menu and returns focus to the activator that opened it, which is this
 * dialog's own ".*" button. Left unguarded, this listener still ran on the very same keydown
 * afterwards, read the *new* `document.activeElement` (the button `v-menu` had just focused,
 * not the control the press actually started on), and stepped it one place further -- turning
 * a boundary `v-menu` had already handled correctly into one this dialog then mishandled.
