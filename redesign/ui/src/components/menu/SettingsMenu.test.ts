/**
 * Settling the visual audit's Priority 3 finding for `menu-search.png`
 * (`docs/visual-audit-2026-08-05.md`): does typing into the viewer's in-map Settings menu
 * search genuinely filter the rendered list, or does it show a match count while leaving
 * content unfiltered underneath it?
 *
 * It was a real, confirmed defect for one specific shape of group. `show()` correctly
 * narrows a switch- or slider-based group down to the member whose own label matches -
 * searching "sunlight" genuinely hides the Ambient-Light slider beside it, and always did.
 * But every group built on `MenuOptionList` (View/Controls, Resolution, Theme, Language)
 * used to hand it the *entire* unfiltered options array regardless of the query:
 * `MenuOptionList` itself has no filtering of its own, so once the group's outer
 * `v-if="show(...)"` passed because *any one* member matched, every sibling option
 * rendered whether or not it individually matched. Searching "Perspective" - a name that
 * is not a substring of "Flat" or "Free-Flight" - used to show all three, which is exactly
 * the "9 of 60, but the panel looks unfiltered" shape the audit flagged, reproducing on a
 * specific, deliberately chosen query rather than only on the audit's short "re" (which
 * spuriously matches several group *titles* too, a separate and milder effect the second
 * describe block below is about).
 *
 * Fixed in `SettingsMenu.vue` by filtering what actually reaches each `MenuOptionList`
 * down to the options `show()` itself would keep - the group's own title, plus that one
 * option's own name - the same two-candidate rule every switch- and slider-based group
 * already applies per member, so a category-name search still reveals the whole category
 * (`visibleQualityOptions` etc.) while an option-specific search now narrows to it.
