                        renders this slot first and its own commands underneath, so opening
                        the row and removing it stay where a user already expects them and
                        **Edit appearance...** arrives as an addition rather than a
                        replacement.

                        Opening shows the keys that do the same thing from the keyboard, so
                        the menu teaches the shortcut rather than hiding it. Removing shows
                        none because it has none: the gate is reached by Tab from the row,
                        not by a key, and padding the column with a made-up chord would train
                        somebody to press it.
