/**
 * The licence viewer as a panel the user places.
 *
 * The second docked surface in the application, and the reason `DockedSurface` is a
 * wrapper rather than something bolted onto the settings sheet: this one wants to default
 * to the bottom edge, because a legal document is read in wide short lines and because a
 * left or right dock would sit on top of the settings sheet somebody opened it from.
 *
 * Its placement is remembered separately from every other panel's, it carries its own
 * chooser in its own title bar, and the global reset in Settings reaches it whether or not
 * it is open.
 *
 * The viewer itself is also embedded directly - in the first-run flow's licence step and
 * in the consent settings row - because those are surfaces the reader is already inside.
 * This is the standalone route: mount one in the shell and open it from anywhere.
