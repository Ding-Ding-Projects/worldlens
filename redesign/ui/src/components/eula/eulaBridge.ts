/**
 * Asking the main process for Mojang's EULA, and being honest about what came back.
 *
 * Three things can be on screen, and the controller keeps them apart so no component can
 * accidentally describe one with another's words:
 *
 *  - **live** - fetched from Mojang just now, with the time it happened;
 *  - **cache** - a copy the app fetched earlier and kept, with the time *it* happened.
 *    Shown when the network is unavailable or when the copy is still fresh. It is never
 *    described as current, because a licence can be revised and a stale copy presented as
 *    live is the single genuinely harmful thing this feature could do;
 *  - **fallback** - nothing could be fetched and nothing was cached, so what is on screen
 *    is the four lines BlueMap itself quotes, labelled as a quotation from BlueMap rather
 *    than as Mojang's document.
 *
 * The fallback is the reason `source` is a string rather than a boolean. "We have a
 * document" and "we have *the* document" are different claims and the viewer makes
 * different sentences out of them.
 *
 * ## The bridge method is optional, and its absence is not an error
 *
 * A browser build has no main process, so there is nothing to fetch with and nothing to
 * cache into. That is the same shape as `OptionalStorageBridge` in the setup flow: the
 * method is probed, its absence puts the controller straight into the fallback state with
 * a sentence saying why, and nothing throws. A build that gains the method later needs no
 * change here.
