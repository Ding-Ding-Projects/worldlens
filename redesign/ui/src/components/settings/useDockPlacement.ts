/**
 * The live placement state, shared by every docked surface and by the settings reset.
 *
 * One module-level `ref` rather than a provide/inject tree, for the same reason the
 * appearance store keeps one: the control that resets every surface's placement lives
 * inside a surface that has a placement of its own, and threading a provider through
 * would mean the one component somebody forgets is the one that stops updating. Every
 * write goes through the pure functions in `dockPlacement.ts`, so what is persisted and
 * what is on screen cannot be two different things.
 *
 * ## The registry is a fact, not a claim
 *
 * A surface registers itself while it is mounted and drops out when it unmounts, exactly
 * as an appearance target does. The alternative - a hard-coded inventory of every docked
 * dialog the application is supposed to have - is a list of claims, and its first stale
 * entry is indistinguishable from a bug in the chooser. So the settings surface lists the
 * surfaces that are open right now, and the global reset clears the *stored* record
 * regardless, because a surface that is closed still has a remembered placement and a
 * reset that missed it would be a reset that did not reset.
