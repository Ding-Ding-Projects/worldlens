/**
 * The app's settings surface.
 *
 * Mount exactly one {@link AppSettings} in the shell and hand it three things: whether
 * it is open, the anchor it should reveal, and whether the render that sent somebody
 * here said that setting was *missing* rather than merely wrong. It emits `update:open`
 * and nothing else — it is a side sheet, not a dialog, and it never halts the app behind
 * it.
 *
 * The anchor is the other end of `SettingsTarget` in `world/worldBridge.ts`: a render
 * that stops for a fixable reason names the setting that would fix it, the shell passes
 * that anchor here, and this scrolls to it, focuses it and outlines it. That round trip
 * is the whole point of the surface — everything else is the settings themselves.
