/**
 * Where a docked surface lives, per surface, remembered.
 *
 * The settings surface was a right-hand drawer because somebody had to pick one. On a
 * wide display that is fine; on a tall narrow window it takes half the screen, and for a
 * person whose map is on the right it covers exactly the thing they were looking at. So
 * the placement is a choice: a floating panel, or docked to the left, right, top or
 * bottom edge. Each surface remembers its own, because the answer for a settings sheet
 * and the answer for a document viewer are not the same answer.
 *
 * This module is the whole of the decision-making, as pure functions over plain values,
 * for the usual reason: geometry is where this goes wrong, and it goes wrong in ways no
 * screenshot catches. "Does a bottom dock at 200% scale still leave the button that
 * opened it visible" is a question with one right answer and a test can state it.
 *
 * ## Never covering the control that opened it
 *
 * A surface that covers its own opener is the specific failure this has to avoid: the
 * button is still there, still focusable, still announced, and completely invisible - so
 * a user pressing it again to close the panel is pressing the panel. {@link resolveDockLayout}
 * therefore takes the opener's rectangle and:
 *
 *  - for a docked placement, **shrinks the panel along its docking axis** so its edge stops
 *    short of the opener. A right dock beside a button 520px from the right edge is 520px
 *    wide, not 520px overlapping;
 *  - falls back to **floating** when even {@link MINIMUM_THICKNESS} would not fit, and says
 *    so in the returned layout rather than silently doing something else;
 *  - for a floating panel, picks the corner that does not intersect the opener at all, and
 *    when every corner does, the one that intersects least.
 *
 * There is deliberately no option to overlap anyway. The opener is the control the user
 * pressed a moment ago and expects to press again.
 *
 * ## Where this lives
 *
 * In `components/settings/` because a placement is a setting: the global reset lives on
 * the settings surface, and the surfaces that use it import from here. It is not specific
 * to the settings sheet, and {@link DOCK_PLACEMENTS} carries no knowledge of any
 * particular surface.
 *
 * ## Placement is mirrored into settings history; size and floating position are not
 *
 * {@link writeDockPlacements} calls `recordAppSetting("dockPlacement", ...)` because a
 * placement is a discrete choice made by clicking an option in {@link SurfacePlacementRow.vue}
 * - one write per decision. {@link writeDockSizes} and {@link writeDockFloatingRects} do not,
 * on purpose: `DockedSurface.vue`'s splitter and header drag handlers call `setDockThickness`
 * and `setDockFloatingRect` on **every pointermove frame** while a panel is being resized or
 * moved, not once at drag-end, so mirroring them would turn one drag into dozens of history
 * revisions of pure noise. This exclusion is recorded, with the same reasoning, in
 * `stores/appSettingsHistorySync.ts`'s `EXCLUDED_APP_SETTINGS`.

/**
 * The CSS a layout turns into.
 *
 * Returned as a plain object so the component binds it with `:style` and a test asserts on
 * it without a layout engine. `position: fixed` throughout: a docked surface is chrome
 * over the window, not a participant in the document's flow, and at 200% display scale
 * that is the only way its edge stays the window's edge.
 *
 * A floating panel carries both `height` and `max-height` at the same value, not
 * `max-height` alone. `max-height` alone leaves the panel's own height "auto" as far as a
 * descendant's percentage height is concerned - `.mb-docked__frame`'s `block-size: 100%`
 * then resolves to nothing, the flex chain that is supposed to bound `.mb-docked__body`
 * never engages, and content taller than the panel spills silently past its border with no
 * scrollbar and no way to reach it. `height` gives the frame a real number to be 100% of;
 * `max-height` stays alongside it as the same belt-and-braces the docked top/bottom cases
 * already use (`height: thickness` plus a `max-height` safety net for a shrunk viewport).
