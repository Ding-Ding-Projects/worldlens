/**
 * The novice "Speed" dial in the options editor's Core tab: one 1-5 control
 * that writes `render-thread-count` and `render-thread-priority` in `core.conf`
 * together, so somebody who has never heard of a JVM thread priority still gets
 * to change how hard BlueMap leans on the host machine while it renders.
 *
 * `SpeedControl.vue` is the only renderer of this surface, and it is NOT
 * registered in `surfaces/index.ts` -- per the standing instruction that a new
 * copy surface ships unwired and integration decides when it joins the
 * catalogue. Until then every `t()` call here renders its English, level-1
 * fallback, which is why every fallback string below is written as the real
 * level-1 (fully professional) sentence rather than a placeholder.
 *
 * ## The one fact every level has to keep
 *
 * `speed.custom` is the state that stops this control from ever overwriting a
 * value on its own: it fires whenever the two raw fields do not match any of
 * the five levels exactly, and it says plainly that nothing was changed and
 * nothing will be unless the reader clicks a level. A rewrite that softened
 * that into something that sounds like the app already fixed it for them would
 * be lying about whether their advanced values are still there. `speed.applied`
 * carries the matching half: clicking a level really does overwrite both raw
 * fields, and that fact survives every level too, so nobody clicks "3" expecting
 * a preview and gets a silent write instead.
 *
 * `SPEED_FACTS` pins the numbers themselves -- `render-thread-count` and
 * `render-thread-priority` by name, and the literal level number -- because a
 * message that stops saying *which two settings* it is talking about is not a
 * funnier message, it is a useless one.
