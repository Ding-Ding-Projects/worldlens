/**
 * The profile manager: the list of maps and servers this computer knows about, and the
 * confirmation that takes one of them off it.
 *
 * The list holds two genuinely different kinds of thing, which is why so few of these
 * strings say "profile". A local entry points at tiles rendered on this machine; a remote
 * entry is an address of somebody else's BlueMap. `servers.localMap` and
 * `servers.kindRemote` are the labels that keep them apart, and the delete confirmation
 * builds itself out of whichever one applies.
 *
 * ## The delete notes are three sentences that are never shown together
 *
 * `whatRemovalCosts` in `ProfileManager.vue` assembles the confirmation from
 * `servers.deleteRow`, then exactly one of `servers.deleteLocalNote` or
 * `servers.deleteRemoteNote`, then `servers.deleteActiveNote` if this happens to be the
 * map currently on screen. Each therefore has to stand on its own and say one true thing
 * about one case, because a reader only ever sees the ones that apply to the row they are
 * about to remove.
 *
 * What those notes are protecting against is the reasonable assumption that removing an
 * entry from a list deletes what the entry pointed at. It does not, in either direction:
 * the rendered tiles stay on the disk untouched, and the server on the other end of a
 * remote entry never hears about it. Both halves of that survive level 5, together with
 * the third fact nobody wants to discover afterwards, which is that removing the entry is
 * not undoable from this screen.
