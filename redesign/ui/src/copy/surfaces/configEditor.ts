/**
 * The config screen's editing machinery: the regex builder behind every settings
 * search bar, the search fields themselves, the controls that render one setting, the
 * field rows wrapped around them, and the list, key-value and render-mask editors.
 *
 * One module per surface, spread into `appCopy.ts`. The screen's own furniture (its
 * tab labels, its save and revert copy, its file titles) lives elsewhere; what is here
 * is everything that explains or reports on an *edit*.
 *
 * ## Three obligations this surface has that most do not
 *
 * **The regex copy names a real engine.** `config.regex.engine` says ECMAScript
 * `RegExp` because that is literally what `regexEngine.ts` compiles with, and because
 * the same engine runs the search that consumes the pattern. `config.regex.hint.start`
 * and `.end` name flag `m` because `^` and `$` mean something different without it. A
 * builder whose dialect the user has to guess is a builder they cannot trust, so no
 * level may soften those into "regular expressions" in general.
 *
 * **A syntax error points at the quoted error, never just "invalid".** The engine's
 * own message is rendered beside these strings (a `v-alert` in the builder, the text
 * field's error slot in the search bar), so from level 3 up both `config.regex.invalid`
 * and `config.form.badPattern` say where that message is. They must never imply the
 * pattern failed for a reason nobody can read.
 *
 * **Nothing here rewrites the file to be helpful.** `config.control.colorNotHex`,
 * `config.mask.unknownShape` and `config.form.rawOnly` all report a value this build
 * cannot use, and all three promise it was left exactly as the file writes it. That
 * promise is the fact pinned at every level: an editor that quietly normalises a
 * hand-written file has edited a setting nobody opened.
 *
 * ## Tier overrides against the work list
 *
 * `config.search.builderShort` is the builder button's `.*` glyph, `config.search.regexOff`
 * is the regex toggle's accessible name (its twin `config.search.regexOn` was already
 * fixed), and `config.form.showSource` is one half of a button that says "Hide the file"
 * in its other state. All three are FIXED here: a funny level cannot restyle `.*`, and a
 * toggle whose accessible name moves between states is a toggle a screen-reader user has
 * to re-learn every press.
 *
 * `config.mask.*` is BlueMap's render mask, an ordered list of shapes limiting the area
 * rendered. It has nothing to do with masking a secret; `config.field.secret` is the only
 * credential copy in this module.
