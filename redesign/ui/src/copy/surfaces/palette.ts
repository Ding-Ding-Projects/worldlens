/**
 * The command palette: everything `CommandPalette.vue`, `PaletteRow.vue`, `paletteCatalog.ts`
 * and `viewerSettings.ts` put on screen that is not already voiced somewhere else.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately absent
 *
 * The palette calls `t()` with a great many keys this module does not answer, and every one
 * of them falls into one of two buckets that are wrong to fill in here:
 *
 *  - **Upstream's own words.** `settings.title`, `maps.title`, `markers.title`,
 *    `players.title`, `info.title`, `resetCamera.tooltip`, and the whole run of viewer
 *    settings labels (`controls.title`, `lighting.sunlight`, `resolution.high`,
 *    `renderDistance.hiresLayer`, `mapControls.showZoomButtons`, `freeFlightControls.*`,
 *    `theme.*`, `screenshot.clipboard`, `language.title`, `chunkBorders.button`,
 *    `debug.button`, and the rest) are rows the palette *reuses the name of* rather than
 *    strings it owns. Every one of them is a key from the bundled viewer locales in
 *    `public/lang/*.conf`. Answering them here would replace a real translation in
 *    twenty-nine languages with an English string, which is exactly the mistake
 *    `catalogueCoverage.test.ts` exists to catch.
 *  - **Another surface's own key.** `config.title`, `notices.centre.title` and
 *    `changelog.title` are this app's own words, and they already have a catalogue entry -
 *    `chrome.ts` for the first, `appCopy.ts` for the second, `changelog.ts` for the third -
 *    because those keys are shared with the surfaces that opened first. Repeating them here
 *    would not be wrong so much as pointless: the merge is keyed by string, so whichever
 *    entry loads is the one that answers both call sites, and a second one just sits unused.
 *
 * What *is* answered here are the two screen names the palette currently is the only place
 * in the whole package that names: `servers.title` ("Servers", the destination row that opens
 * the server list when the shell has no tab strip of its own) and `tabs.finder.title` ("Find a
 * tab", the tab strip's own search). Neither is an upstream key - `public/lang/*.conf` has no
 * such paths - and neither has a call site anywhere outside `paletteCatalog.ts` yet. They are
 * this app's own words with nowhere else claiming them, so they belong here until whichever
 * surface actually owns that screen grows a matching call site of its own.
 *
 * ## Titles versus descriptions, the same split every other surface uses
 *
 * A row's `title` is a name, so it is FIXED: "Appearance preset" does not read differently at
 * five funny levels, and a name that moves under somebody is a name they have to re-read. A
 * row's `description` and every `where.*` sentence are prose that tells the reader what a row
 * actually is or what choosing it actually does, so those are VOICED. `paletteItems.ts` draws
 * exactly this line for the type itself: `title` is short, `description` is "one sentence
 * saying what it is", and `where` is "a plain sentence naming the surface this opens" - never
 * blank, because a row that moves somebody without saying where is worse than a menu item.
 *
 * The viewer settings under `viewerSettings.ts` follow the same split against upstream's own
 * naming: the label on each row (`lighting.sunlight`, `resolution.title`, and so on) is
 * upstream's word for the control and stays untouched, but the one sentence explaining what
 * the control actually does (`palette.sunlight.description`, `palette.resolution.description`)
 * is this app's own addition, sitting beside a control the settings page itself has no
 * equivalent sentence for. Voicing it here is not overriding upstream; it is the only place
 * that sentence exists at all.
