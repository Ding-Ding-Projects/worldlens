/**
 * The notification centre's bulk-action toolbar and its per-row selection checkbox:
 * `NoticeBulkToolbar.vue` and `NoticeSelectCheckbox.vue`.
 *
 * Both components live at the top of `components/`, next to `PathField.vue`, rather than
 * inside `components/notifications/` with the panel that hosts them. That is not a filing
 * accident: `components/notifications` is a finished surface in `catalogueCoverage.test.ts`,
 * every `t()` key rendered from anywhere inside it has to resolve in the merged catalogue,
 * and this module is deliberately not registered there yet (see the note below). Keeping the
 * two components that actually call these keys outside that folder is what lets the bulk
 * toolbar exist without either wiring a half-written catalogue entry into the finished
 * surface or inventing a home for orphan prose. `NoticeCentrePanel.vue` mounts them as
 * children and adds no `t()` call of its own for anything they render.
 *
 * ## Registration happens in a later phase
 *
 * This module is not yet imported by `surfaces/index.ts`, so it is not reachable through
 * `APP_VOICED`/`APP_FIXED`/`FACTS` and is not exercised by `appCopy.test.ts` or
 * `catalogueCoverage.test.ts`. `pathField.ts` and `project.test.ts` hold their own surfaces
 * to the same shape those files would, ahead of registration, for the same reason:
 * `notificationsBulk.test.ts` does that here.
 *
 * ## The four explanations, and what has to survive every funny level
 *
 * `noticeBulk.dismissExplain`, `...exportExplain`, `...markReadExplain` and
 * `...deleteExplain` are the sentence each bulk action shows before it runs, alongside the
 * exact count from `../../components/notifications/noticeBulk.ts`'s own impact functions.
 * Each one pins a fact a playful rewrite must not lose, checked in `NOTIFICATIONSBULK_FACTS`:
 *
 *   - dismiss says the notice is still in the history, because clearing the corner is not
 *     deleting anything and a level that stops saying so turns a safe action into a scary one;
 *   - export says the count matches the active filter, because an export that quietly widens
 *     to everything is not the export the button claimed;
 *   - mark-as-read says other notices "in between" ride along, because the read state is one
 *     shared line rather than a flag per notice (see that module's own comment) and a level
 *     that drops this turns a surprising side effect into a silent one;
 *   - delete says it cannot be undone, because it is the one truly destructive action here
 *     and the whole point of the super-confirmation gate it sits behind is that the person
 *     dragging the slider knows exactly what they are agreeing to.
 *
 * Everything else in this file is a control label or an accessible name: `pathField.ts`'s
 * own reasoning for keeping `pathField.browse.aria` and `pathField.dialogTitle` FIXED applies
 * here without change. A checkbox whose accessible name reads differently every time somebody
 * nudges a funny-level slider is a checkbox a screen-reader user has to re-learn mid-review.
