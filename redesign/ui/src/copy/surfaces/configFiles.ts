/**
 * The config screen's file management: the maps and the storages it edits, the config-folder
 * shell that opens, generates, saves and deletes them, the run screen that says what BlueMap
 * will actually be asked to do, the marker sets written into a map config, and the two gates
 * that stand in front of a save that deletes something.
 *
 * This is the surface where a sentence is load-bearing rather than decorative, so three
 * distinctions are pinned into `CONFIGFILES_FACTS` and survive level 5 in both languages.
 *
 * **Saved is not rendered.** `config.shell.needsRender` and `config.apply.reRenderTitle` are
 * the only warning anybody gets that the folder on disk now disagrees with the tiles a
 * visitor is being served. Saving changes config files; it never starts a render. A level
 * that lets "have to be rendered again" soften into "will update" has told the reader the
 * opposite of what happened.
 *
 * **A delete names its file, and names what it does not take.** `config.apply.deleteAction`
 * keeps the folder, "the files listed below", "keeps no copy" and "cannot put them back" in
 * all ten strings. `config.storages.deleteKeepsTiles` keeps the other half: the tiles that
 * are already written are NOT deleted, and dropping that half inverts the message from "your
 * config is going" into "your rendered world is going". The house standard for both is
 * `config.maps.deleteTiles` and `config.storages.deleteBreaks` in `appCopy.ts`.
 *
 * **Nothing is on disk until you save.** Adding, duplicating and generating all produce
 * entries that exist only in memory, and every one of those messages says so. It is the
 * sentence that makes the delete gate honest later: if a reader believes a new file was
 * already written, they cannot reason about what the save is about to do.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately *not* here
 *
 * `config.maps.deleteAction`, `config.maps.deleteTiles`, `config.maps.idTaken`,
 * `config.maps.nameTaken`, `config.storages.deleteAction`, `config.storages.deleteBreaks`,
 * `config.shell.openFailed`, `config.shell.saved`, `config.shell.save`, `config.apply.title`,
 * `config.apply.cancel`, `config.apply.reRenderBody` and `config.saved` belong to this
 * surface and are written directly in `appCopy.ts`. Entries there win a collision with a
 * surface module, so repeating them here would be dead weight at best and a silent
 * divergence at worst.
 *
 * ## Near-duplicates that are deliberate
 *
 * There are three "the pattern is not valid" keys, one per search bar, and they are not
 * consolidated: each names the thing its own list was about to show, so a reader who has two
 * of these screens open can tell which search is broken. `config.shell.nothingToSave` and
 * `config.apply.nothing` are likewise the same news in two places, the first from the save
 * button and the second inside the dialog that was about to write, and they are worded apart
 * so that seeing both at once does not read as the app stuttering. `config.maps.deleted` and
 * `config.storages.deleted` diverge only at the top levels, where the storage one adds the
 * reassurance about tiles that the map one has no business making.
