/**
 * The menu side sheet and everything that lives inside it: the About page, the search bar
 * that every menu carries, the anchored regex builder behind that search bar, the super
 * confirmation slider, and the one setting in here that destroys something.
 *
 * ## Two registers in one module, on purpose
 *
 * Most of this surface is labels, so most of it is FIXED. The six voiced entries are the
 * ones that report something a reader has to act on: a version this build could not
 * produce, a search that matched nothing, a pattern that will not compile, and a reset
 * that cannot be taken back.
 *
 * ## Terms that stay in English
 *
 * `ECMAScript RegExp`, `pattern`, `flags` and `backslash` are the names of the thing the
 * builder actually runs, and a reader carrying a pattern between this app and their
 * editor needs them to be the same word in both. `regexBuilder.engine` names the dialect
 * exactly because a builder that will not say which engine it is cannot be trusted with
 * an escape rule.
