/**
 * Publishing a rendered map to GitHub Pages: the phase readout, GitHub's own build status,
 * the `gh` sign-in check, the repository-visibility choice, and the notices raised when a
 * publish finishes, resumes, or is taken down again.
 *
 * `appCopy.ts` already carries this surface's long-form prose: the pitch, the caveats with
 * their two GitHub limits, the decompression note, the acknowledgement, the stop action and
 * the live-versus-built distinction. This module is the rest of the screen.
 *
 * ## The one distinction this whole surface is built around
 *
 * GitHub saying it built a site and the address actually answering are two different facts,
 * and rounding the first up into the second turns an honest status into a green tick over a
 * dead link. `appCopy.ts` pins that on `pages.status.live` and `pages.status.built`; the
 * entries here have to stay on the right side of the same line. `pages.phase.verifying` is
 * the step that establishes it, so it says what it is doing rather than announcing success,
 * and `pages.status.errored` says GitHub's build failed rather than that something went
 * a bit wrong.
 *
 * ## Why the two visibility options are voiced and not labels
 *
 * They read like radio-button captions and they are not: each one states a consequence the
 * user is choosing between. Public means anybody who finds the address downloads the whole
 * map; private means Pages needs a paid plan. Those are the entire decision, so they carry
 * five levels and their facts are pinned. A caption that got playful and dropped "anybody
 * can download the map" would be the app hiding the cost of the option it recommends.
