/**
 * The render console: the engine's own output, the level filter over it, and everything
 * that says which slice of it you are actually looking at.
 *
 * The engine's lines themselves never pass through this catalogue. They are the strings
 * somebody pastes into a search engine, and an app that improves them has taken away the
 * one thing that was going to help. What is here is the frame around them: how many lines
 * are on screen, how many the ring buffer has already thrown away, what a copy or an
 * export actually contains, and why the view stopped following.
 *
 * Two rules govern this surface in particular.
 *
 * **A severity word is never restyled.** `world.console.level.error` is "Errors" and
 * `world.console.level.warning` is "Warnings", in every mode, at every level. They are
 * FIXED for exactly that reason: they name what a line is, they are read beside a colour
 * swatch that some readers cannot see, and a playful synonym would make the one signal
 * that has to survive a monochrome screen ambiguous. The frame around a log line may be
 * funny; the level of the line may not.
 *
 * **A slice says it is a slice.** The cap drops the beginning of a long render, and a
 * filter hides the middle of it. Both look exactly like a complete log to somebody who
 * was not watching, so `capDropped`, `exportFiltered` and `exportDropped` carry their
 * counts into all ten of their strings and say plainly that lines are missing. An export
 * that covers a tenth of a render and does not admit it is worse than no export: the
 * reader draws conclusions from an absence that is an artefact of a filter.
