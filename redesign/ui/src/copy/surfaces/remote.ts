/**
 * Maps and servers: where a render runs, Docker's state on this computer, the machines
 * somebody has set up to render on, and the four checks a machine passes before a byte of
 * their world leaves this one.
 *
 * ## Why this surface is the least forgiving one in the catalogue
 *
 * Every other screen can lose a clause to a joke and cost somebody a re-read. This one
 * carries credentials, trust decisions and network failures, where a lost clause costs
 * something else entirely:
 *
 * - **"not reachable yet" and "wrong credentials" are different facts.** So are "the daemon
 *   is not running" and "Docker is not installed", and "the key changed" and "the key could
 *   not be read". Each pair has an opposite fix, and a level that rounds either of them to
 *   "having trouble" has sent somebody to fix the wrong thing. The `_FACTS` entries below
 *   pin the distinguishing half of every pair.
 * - **A failure reads as a failure at level 5.** A refused connection, a timeout and an
 *   untrusted host key are said in those words at every level. Playfulness lives in the
 *   sentence around them, never in the verdict.
 * - **The credential clauses are load-bearing.** "A path, never the key itself", "no
 *   password field anywhere in this feature", "nothing is recorded until you accept" and
 *   "a complete copy of your world stays on that machine" are the sentences somebody makes
 *   a decision on. They appear verbatim in all ten strings of their entry.
 *
 * Host names, ports, paths, commands and version strings are identifiers and are identical
 * in both languages: `'docker version'`, `ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`,
 * `PATH`, `Docker Desktop` and `{version}` all read the same to a Cantonese reader, because
 * they are things to type or to search for rather than things to read.

     * solved by starting Docker Desktop, and "not installed" by downloading it. So every
     * level of the daemon-down entries keeps "is installed", and every level of the missing
