/**
 * The settings screen: its own search bar, the docked-panel chrome every settings surface
 * is wrapped in, the Java runtime row, the folder rendered maps are written into, the
 * world-folder explanation, and the placement list that puts every panel back at once.
 *
 * One module per surface, spread into `appCopy.ts`. The split is not cosmetic: the
 * catalogue is the one file in this package that several people edit at once, and a single
 * two-thousand-entry object literal makes every one of those edits touch the same hunk.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately *not* here
 *
 * `settings.java.title`, `settings.java.description`, `settings.java.notFound`,
 * `settings.storage.title`, `settings.storage.description`, `settings.storage.saved`,
 * `settings.storage.relative`, `settings.github.title` and the whole of
 * `settings.consent.*` and `settings.language.*` are settings keys and are written
 * directly in `appCopy.ts`. They were there before this module existed and an entry here
 * would be shadowed by them anyway, because `appCopy.ts` spreads the surface modules first
 * so that its own entries win a collision. Two definitions of one key, one of which never
 * renders, is the kind of thing that survives review for a year.
 *
 * ## The `dock.*` keys
 *
 * They live here rather than in `chrome.ts` because `DockedSurface.vue` lives under
 * `components/settings/`, and because the only thing that reads `dock.placement.left` and
 * friends is the settings screen's own placement list. They are the panel chrome, not the
 * window chrome: `window.close` closes the application, `dock.close` closes a panel.
 *
 * One consequence worth knowing before editing `dock.adjusted.floating`: the `{edge}` it
 * interpolates is a `dock.placement.*` label, so the sentence renders as "to the Docked to
 * the left". The Cantonese wraps it in corner brackets for that reason, which reads as the
 * name of a placement rather than as a preposition that has been said twice.
