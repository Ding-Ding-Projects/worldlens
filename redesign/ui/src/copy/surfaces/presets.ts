/**
 * Project presets, and the lightweight "this is BlueMap's own default" indicator on the
 * project editor's render-options tab.
 *
 * Both live in one module because they answer the same question from two directions: the
 * empty state says "here is what BlueMap would set for you, plainly, before you touch
 * anything", and the render tab says "here is what you already changed, and here is the
 * one button back". Neither is allowed to invent a value. Every number, key and field name
 * a preset writes comes straight from `@worldlens/config`'s own schema and its
 * generated templates - `projectModel.ts`'s own doc comment on `PROJECT_PRESETS` names
 * exactly which schema field backs each one - so this module's job is only to say, in
 * words, what those functions already do.
 *
 * ## Why the "applied" lines are four keys instead of one
 *
 * `applyPreset` composes rather than overwrites: it skips a map id the project already
 * has, leaves an existing storage alone, and never touches a `webserver.conf` the project
 * already carries. A single fixed "Preset applied!" sentence would be a lie the second time
 * somebody presses the same button, or the moment a preset is applied to a project that
 * already has an overworld map. So each of the three things a preset can do -
 * `appliedMaps`/`appliedMapsNone`, `appliedStorage`/`appliedStorageSkipped`,
 * `appliedWebserver`/`appliedWebserverSkipped` - carries its own pair, one for "this
 * happened" and one for "this was already true", and the component decides which half to
 * show from `PresetApplication`'s own booleans rather than this module guessing.
 *
 * ## `project.fieldDefault.*`, not `project.presets.*`
 *
 * The render-options default indicator has nothing to do with presets - it is the answer
 * to requirement 3, "make BlueMap's default first-class wherever the editor shows a
 * value", for the one place in the project editor that had no such indicator yet (every
 * other value in this editor already goes through `../config/ConfigField.vue`, which has
 * carried this for every real config field since before this module existed). It is kept
 * here rather than in a third file because it is new copy from the same task, and it is
 * kept under its own `project.fieldDefault.*` prefix, not `project.presets.*`, so it reads
 * honestly as its own feature rather than as a preset side effect.
