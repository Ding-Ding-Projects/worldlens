/**
 * "Renders in progress": every render this application knows about, on every route, in one
 * list - reachable regardless of which screen (if any) started it or is watching it.
 *
 * ## What actually needed fixing, and what this page adds on top of it
 *
 * The reported defect - navigate away and a render is lost - turned out to be the *view*
 * being lost, not the render: `main/render/orchestrator.ts` keeps every running render in a
 * `Map` that belongs to the main process, entirely independent of any window or component,
 * and a container render survives the whole application closing because Docker's daemon
 * owns its lifetime. `activeRenders.ts`'s own file header has the full account. This
 * catalogue is the copy for the page that makes that truth visible: a place that always
 * knows what is running, a tab label that carries a live count wherever the strip is drawn,
 * and a Home tile that leads to the same place.
 *
 * ## Voiced sparingly, and on purpose
 *
 * Most of this surface's strings are short labels - a state, a route, a button caption - and
 * stay `_FIXED` rather than five-level prose: "Running" does not get funnier at level 5, and
 * pretending otherwise would be decoration standing in for information on a list somebody is
 * scanning quickly. What *is* voiced is the handful of real sentences: the page's own
 * introduction, the three empty states (which distinguish "still checking" from "genuinely
 * nothing" - a distinction this page's whole contract rests on, so both stay exact at every
 * level), and the destructive bulk-cancel explanation `ConfigSuperConfirm` shows before its
 * slider can even move.
