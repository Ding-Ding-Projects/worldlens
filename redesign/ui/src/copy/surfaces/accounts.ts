/**
 * The multi-account list: every GitHub account this computer has stored, not only the one
 * signed in right now.
 *
 * A new surface file rather than an addition to `github.ts` next door, because this lane
 * owns exactly this file and nothing else in `copy/` - see the house rule that a new
 * surface lands here, unregistered, and integration is what spreads it into the catalogue
 * everything else reads from. Until then these keys resolve through `useI18n().t`'s own
 * fallback argument, which is why every call site below carries the English text a second
 * time: the same pattern `GITHUB_FIXED` and `GITHUB_VOICED` already use.
 *
 * ## The one rule this surface keeps from its neighbour
 *
 * Every string here is within reach of a credential exactly as `github.ts`'s own header
 * says, so the same ban holds: no level ever quotes a token, and a refusal names what was
 * wrong (no such account, could not switch, could not renew) without repeating anything
 * secret. Account logins, scope names and the main process's own reasons stay identical in
 * both languages, because a translated `read:org` or a translated login sends the reader
 * looking for something that does not exist.
 *
 * ## The fact every removal has to keep
 *
 * Removing the *active* account is not always the end of being signed in: another stored
 * account can become active in its place. `settings.github.accounts.removedFallback` and
 * `settings.github.accounts.removedNone` are the two ways that goes, and they may not be
 * rounded into one another at any level - the whole reason the list reports a fallback
 * account by name is so a person does not have to check for themselves which is true.
