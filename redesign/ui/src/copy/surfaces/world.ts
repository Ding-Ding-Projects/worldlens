/**
 * The "Make a map" wizard: choosing a world, naming the map, its options, where it is
 * written, reviewing it, running it, and the renders that stopped without finishing.
 *
 * `catalogueCoverage.test.ts` named `components/world` as "not started" before this module
 * existed -- 15 of 234 keys had a catalogue entry, all of them living directly in
 * `appCopy.ts` rather than here. This module now covers the rest: all ten `.vue` components
 * in the directory, plus the four lower-case helper modules whose own functions build the
 * strings some of those components display, in the directory's own alphabetical order:
 *
 *   DockerWorldSourcePanel.vue, InterruptedRenders.vue, MapIdentityStep.vue, MapOptionsStep.vue, MapStorageStep.vue,
 *   MinecraftWorldList.vue, RenderRunPanel.vue, SshWorldSourcePanel.vue,
 *   WizardReviewStep.vue, WorldFolderStep.vue, WorldScreen.vue, WorldWizard.vue,
 *   renderRun.ts, resumeOffers.ts, worldCatalog.ts,
 *   worldFolder.ts
 *
 * A prior pass covered the first six `.vue` files and left two consequences of stopping at a
 * file boundary rather than a feature boundary on record; both are resolved now that the
 * helper modules are covered too:
 *
 *  - `InterruptedRenders.vue`'s render descriptions, computed in `resumeOffers.ts` through
 *    `describeInterruption`/`describeProgress`/`describeRefusal`, are voiced.
 *  - `MinecraftWorldList.vue`'s per-world subtitle line, built in `worldCatalog.ts` through
 *    `worldDetailLine`/`worldSearchText`/`worldOptionName`, is voiced.
 *
 * `consentState.ts`, `index.ts`, `wizardModel.ts`, `wizardSteps.ts` and `worldBridge.ts`
 * carry no `world.*` call sites of their own (`wizardSteps.ts` supplies the step-title keys
 * that `WorldFolderStep.vue`/`WorldWizard.vue` call `t()` with), so there is nothing further
 * to cover in `components/world` once this module answers everything above.
 *
 * This module is now registered in `surfaces/index.ts`, and `components/world` is on
 * `catalogueCoverage.test.ts`'s `COVERED_SURFACES` list.
 *
 * See `appCopy.ts` for the tier rules this follows: VOICED for prose that explains, warns or
 * reports (blurbs, empty states, notices with a genuine fact to protect), FIXED for titles,
 * field labels, placeholders, button captions and short status chips. Search field labels
 * and hints stay FIXED throughout, matching `history.searchHint` and its siblings; "showing
 * N of M" summaries stay FIXED, matching `pages.renders.summary`. `world.options.badPattern`
 * and `world.options.matches` reuse the exact English `configEditor.ts` already settled on
 * for `config.form.badPattern` and `config.form.matches` -- this step re-implements the same
 * search-and-filter pattern for the wizard's own settings list, so the same sentence answers
 * both rather than a second one being invented to say the same thing. The problem/fix pairs
 * `worldFolder.ts` builds through `describeWorldProblem` -- `world.folder.noLevelDat`/
 * `noRegionData`/`savesFolder` already voiced in `appCopy.ts`, their `*Fix` siblings and the
 * remaining problem codes voiced here -- follow that same precedent rather than being
 * downgraded to FIXED for their brevity.
 *
 * ## Three key families that are genuinely uncatalogueable, not merely unfinished
 *
 * `renderRun.ts` builds three families of string as plain `{ key, fallback, ... }` data --
 * `SIGNALS` (`world.console.signal.*`), `phaseText()` (`world.run.phase.*`), and
 * `FailureRemedy.actionKey` (`world.run.fail.*Action`) -- each read later through a *computed*
 * `t(someObject.key, ...)` call in `RenderConsole.vue` or `RenderRunPanel.vue`. That is a
 * property access, never a literal `t("...")` call, so no scan of this package's source can
 * ever find a call site for these 20 keys -- not the coverage scanner in
 * `catalogueCoverage.test.ts`, not the orphan-check scanner in `appCopy.test.ts`. A prior pass
 * voiced all 20 anyway; the finalize pass that registered this module into the merged
 * catalogue hit exactly the failure this creates -- `appCopy.test.ts`'s "finds a call site for
 * every key in the catalogue" check named all 20 as orphans the moment they became reachable
 * through `surfaces/index.ts`. They were removed rather than kept, matching the precedent
 * `downloads.ts` already set for the identical shape: its `UNITS` array builds
 * `{ key: "downloads.size.tb", fallback, ... }` the same way, and only `downloads.size.b`
 * (which does have a literal call site) is voiced -- `downloads.size.tb`/`gb`/`mb`/`kb` are
 * deliberately left uncatalogued for this exact reason. Fixing the underlying gap for real
 * would mean adding a literal `t("world.console.signal.starting", ...)` call somewhere the
 * component actually reaches, which is an application-code change outside a copy pass. The
 * sibling `world.run.fail.*` explanation keys (`consent`, `java`, `world`, `storage`,
 * `nothing`, and the rest) are unaffected and stay voiced: `adviseOnFailure()` passes those
 * through a real literal `t("world.run.fail.consent", ...)` call, so they have a genuine call
 * site the scanners can find.
