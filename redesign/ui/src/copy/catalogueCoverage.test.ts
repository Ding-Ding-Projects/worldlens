/**
 * The guard that stops the catalogue quietly emptying itself out again.
 *
 * `i18nFallback.test.ts` next door asks whether a fallback string is *shaped* correctly. It
 * never asks whether the key has a catalogue entry at all, and that is the gap this file
 * closes. The two failures are unrelated and only one of them is visible:
 *
 *   - a malformed fallback renders a value as nothing, and somebody eventually notices a
 *     sentence with a hole in it;
 *   - a *missing* catalogue entry renders the English fallback, perfectly, in English, to
 *     somebody who chose 廣東話. Nothing is malformed. Nothing is empty. Both funny sliders
 *     move and this string does not. It reads as a half-finished translation, and no test
 *     had ever asked the question.
 *
 * That is how the catalogue came to answer thirty-five keys out of fifteen hundred while
 * every test in the package passed. A screen added tomorrow with no voiced copy would have
 * done exactly the same thing, silently, forever.
 *
 * ## What this file asserts, and why it is a list rather than a number
 *
 * A percentage would be the obvious assertion and it is the wrong one, because a percentage
 * that drifts down by half a point per screen never fails and never gets fixed. So the
 * assertion is a **named list of surfaces that are finished**, and for each of them the rule
 * is absolute: every key that surface renders has a catalogue entry. Add a key to a finished
 * surface without voicing it and this test names the key, the surface and the file.
 *
 * `COVERED_SURFACES` is expected to grow, one entry per screen, until it is every surface in
 * the package. It is deliberately not the whole package today: this catalogue is being
 * filled a screen at a time, and a test that failed on all of it at once would be switched
 * off within the week. What it must never do is shrink, and it must never be allowed to
 * become vacuous -- `the covered list is real` below fails if a named surface has no keys or
 * no prose, which is what would happen if somebody "fixed" a failure by renaming a folder.
 *
 * ## The other half: keys this catalogue must NOT answer
 *
 * About eighty keys that look exactly like ours belong to upstream BlueMap's viewer, and the
 * thirty `public/lang/*.conf` files translate them into thirty languages. `mergeVoiceInto`
 * merges our catalogue *on top of* the loaded locale, so an entry here for `maps.title`
 * replaces a real German string with an English one. Voicing them would look like progress
 * on this test's own numbers while making the app worse in twenty-nine languages, so the
 * rule is enforced rather than remembered.

/**
 * Paths under `src/`, relative and with forward slashes. A surface is finished when every
 * `t()` key rendered from anywhere inside it resolves in the catalogue.
 *
 * THIS LIST IS EXPECTED TO GROW. Adding a screen's copy to `copy/surfaces/` and its path
 * here is one change, and the second half is the half that keeps it true. Removing an entry
 * is not a way to fix a failure: it is a statement that the screen went back to speaking
 * English at people who did not choose English.
 *
 * One surface is deliberately absent because two of its call sites are genuinely
 * untranslatable, and naming it here is the honest alternative to a guard that quietly
 * asserts less than it appears to:
 *
 *   components/project   `surfaces/project.ts` now covers every literal call site in all
 *                        five `.vue` files and `projectModel.ts`'s `project.row.*` cluster,
 *                        202 of 204 keys. The last two, `project.list.key.open` and
 *                        `project.list.key.choose` in `ProjectList.vue`, pass a computed
 *                        keyboard-key label (`Enter`, `Space`) as the call's fallback with
 *                        no literal string for the scanner to read and no placeholder to
 *                        carry it, so a catalogue entry here would either fail to answer the
 *                        call or hard-code the wrong key name in every language. This stays
 *                        off the list until that call shape changes.
 *
 * `components/config` (`surfaces/configFiles.ts`'s config.storages, config.apply and
 * config.run keys covering the maps and storages it writes, the config-folder shell, the
 * render controls and the apply gates, alongside `surfaces/configEditor.ts`'s editing
 * machinery), `components/world` (the whole "Make a map" wizard, all ten `.vue` files plus
 * the four helper modules that own `world.*` call sites of their own) and `components/palette`
 * (the command palette, all 85 of its own keys) are all fully covered now and appear below.
 *
 * The bottom `describe` block prints the exact remaining count per surface on every run, so
 * the size of that gap is a number somebody reads rather than a claim in a comment.
